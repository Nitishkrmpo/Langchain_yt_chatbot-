chunk 0 : the green card cost right now is

$800,000 which is about 78

CR so what is the solution for them I

can help you get a collateral free loan

of up to $400,000 from us itself and

that costs about 4.95 or 5% per anom and

the deal is even for a tourist visa if

I'm not wrong just to go to the US

there's a waiting list of how long by

2026 early or mid you'll get an

appointment what is the primary reason

that these rich Indians are looking to

buy a US citizen ship if I can give you

an example when I was staying there they

put up boards all across our street

saying they'll be uh building a new road

it was 10 11 at night I was about to

sleep and I said there's no work going

on next day morning 7:00 a.m. I woke up

and there was a new so the better way is

to have quits quickly 21 years they'll

become and then they can sponsor me you

have a brilliant plan you don't need me

for any kind of consultation guys I'm

all about hacks what are some of the

mistakes or pitfalls that people usually

do due to which they get blacklisted

Visa gets rejected and they get kicked

out of the country there are a lot of

children who work outside the campus

illegally which they should not be doing

so tell me this if i' never get the

green card is it theoretically possible

to live in the US indefinitely yes and

[Music]

no hey guys welcome back to another

episode of the one person Club show I

know it's been a while so on today's

episode we have Mr deesh deshmuk who is

an expert on US immigration now with

Donald Trump coming in a lot of things

has changed about the American dream so

if you are somebody who is looking at

moving to the US for a better life or if

you're already somebody in the US

already studying already working and

you're not sure about what your future

looks like then this episode is going to

be absolutely super informational for

you so make sure you watch till the end

so Mr thees thank you so much for coming

back the second time to the 1 person

Club show my pleasure let's address the

elephant in the room what the hell is

this golden card that President Trump

has brought about I've heard about the

Dubai UAE golden card right but what is

this us golden card please educate us so

earlier there was a program called eb5

under which you could get a green card

by investing

$800,000 and you had to create 10

American jobs so almost 56c if you

invest create eight American jobs you

get a green card Green Card 10 jobs you

create and you get a green card green

card so though it's called the gold gold

card the outcome the result will be

getting a green card because that is the

card that us has but what he's doing is

he has increased the limit from $800,000

or a million do to $5 million so his

point is I don't want too many people in

the US people who are rich wealthy can

invest and get the green card and come

and live happily permanently in our

country there is a long time they can

make a decision but now everyone has

lost their sleep because even if you are

ready to put 5 million why will you put

5 million when you can get the same

thing for

$800,000 so everybody is like hurrying

up let's do this J J say before the new

rule kicks in correct correct correct

and there's a lot of people waiting in

line to invest this $800,000 to move

into the US oh you have no idea what is

that right now even for a tourist visa

if I'm not wrong just to go to the US

chill in Vegas and come back yes there's

a waiting list of how long by 2026 early

or mid you'll get an appointment so

there's almost like a 2-year waiting

list just to go to the US to enjoy and

come back just to get the visa just to

get a tourist visa yes now you're saying

this sort of a waiting list will soon

happen for the eb5 program as well

correct because people are scared that

800,000 say 5 million so I need to hurry

up correct and the reason the waight

list is US gives 10,000 eb5 green cards

per year and they give 700 Green cards

per country

so if from India they get 500 600 700

Green cards then those people will get

in one one half year the green card but

if suddenly 3,000 people file then they

will get in the queue so 700 will get in

this year 7 700 allocated per country

per country that's it that's it okay so

what is the primary reason that these

rich Indians are uh looking to buy a US

citizenship or a US green card like why

do they want to do it in the first place

the quality of life which I had even

discussed the last time with you is

something that people look at you know

because for a normal human being

everything is perfect you know when you

pay taxes there you don't feel bad the

roads are nice the bridges are nice

you're not stuck in traffic jam 99%

absolutely air is breathable so 99% of

the US is definitely uh like that and

that is the reason people would want to

move by investing so much money okay do

you know any do you have any like

friends of yours who have actually done

this who have actually gone to the US so

many a lot of people are confused about

this they said oh I love India I don't

want to give up my Indian passport but

no a green card means you have a US

green card or a resident permit on your

Indian passport so you always remain the

citizen of India and after 5 years of

getting your green card if you choose to

you can file for a citizenship and then

you can get the US Passport so if I have

the green card with me on my Indian

passport what are the powers that I get

can you just tell about the superpowers

I have so the first thing is unlike any

other Visa it does not expire or I mean

anything expires but it just gets

renewed perpetually whereas uh a a

student visa will expire uh a work

permit will either expire or if you are

fired from your job within 2 months if

you don't find another job which will

sponsor your H1B you will have to leave

the us correct so there are a lot of

issues so yes a Visa allows you to live

there study work but it does not

guarantee you a Perpetual life in the US

whereas a green card will guarantee you

a Perpetual life the name uh of the uh

Visa is permanent residency right so

permanent means it is permanent nobody

can take it away from you but does it

also give me uh access to other

countries Visa free or so Visa free yes

so a lot of countries you get you can

travel visa free if you have a US Green

Card forget a US Green Card even if you

have a US tourist visa you can go to

countries like UA Dubai and all you can

just show your us tourist Visa or of

course the green card and you can get

14-day or now even they allow a

long-term Visa okay for visa on arrival

now considering the current world's

landscape which uh the countries that a

rich person might want to go to for a

better quality of life it could be the

US UK Australia Dubai what is your topic

and why so topic whether it is mine or

anybody's right us always has been a top

top pick because if I can give you an

example yeah when I us to live in Boston

uh I remember Boston is where Harvard is

yes okay so um so it was almost 2 2:

a.m. and I was driving home and a cop

stopped me siren behind you pull over

and then I knew I was not speeding so I

asked him officer what happened and he

said you your tire touched the white

line three times either you're drunk or

you're sleepy okay if you don't look

like drunk that means you're sleepy and

I said yes officer I am sleepy he said

said pull over take a nap otherwise

you'll die and I said my house is two

exits away I just wanted to get home

then he asked me for a driver's license

he saw my address and he said yes roll

down the windows blast your radio but

don't die okay I go parked my car in my

parking lot I stepped out of my car and

the officer was behind me and he said I

just came to make sure you are reaching

safely to your home good night sir I

don't think we will ever see that day in

India my heart was

touched uh what what are the other

things that the the government does to

me to take care of me make sure there

are no potholes okay of course in fact

uh I remember when I was staying there

uh they put up boards all across our

street saying they'll be uh building a

new road so don't park it was 10 11 at

night I was about to sleep and I said

there's no work going on God knows why

they had put up these signs and all of

that next day 7: a.m. I woke up and

there was a new Street New Street and it

was just unbelievable and after 3 days

they came with uh huge machines and they

planted trees when I'm saying trees

those each tree was two or three stories

high so with a machine they just went z

z and the tree was there wow so they

don't like plant a sapling which will

hopefully grow after 20 years so I mean

these are see they're putting trees they

just put trees okay so so so these are

very small small things but it matter a

lot because here we don't get to see all

of that right okay what else right so

after that when you go to college there

is a concept called institution free fee

okay which means if you're living in a

state and in that state if you're going

to a State University and state

universities are amazing there you get

like a 70 80 or at times 90% discount

compared to what a foreign National will

pay wow so if you're undergrad in Indian

rupees you were to spend 2 to four

crores on a four-year education there

under in institution fee you'll pay

about 78 or $10,000 per anom okay so

about $35 $40,000 is in the whole year

what yeah it's no for the fouryear

education for the fouryear education so

let's talk about people who are in the

middle income group have probably 10

lakh 20 lakh of lifelong savings are

just turned 30 31 and they want to go to

the US student visa what to do God it's

going to be very difficult then because

the H1B Visa it's a lottery based Visa

right it's a work permit which allows

you to live and work in the US but that

is restricted by lottery so they have a

65,000 quota and in one year 7 no that

is for people who are already studying

in the US no I'm talking about people

who are in India they can also apply for

a job if they get a job the employer

will put put their name in the lottery

if the name gets picked in the lottery

they can work okay absolutely and these

are companies like enforces who are

sending their EMP correct no or even a

American company can hire somebody from

India they can do a Skype interview if

they really like that guy and if he has

such talent which is not available in

the US then they can file for their H1B

so an American company hiring a foreign

National whether they are living in us

on student visa or living in India

permanently it doesn't matter so what

are those companies that you've seen uh

us companies uh which uh bring a lot of

people from India to the US based on

their Lottery system so it's mostly tech

companies because that Talent is not

available see H1B is a highly skilled

Visa okay and the law says that you can

only get somebody on H1B if that Talent

is not available in America so somebody

let's say who's done a marketing major

it will be very difficult for that

person to get a H1B Visa because that

Talent is available in the US tech

mostly predominantly is not available so

hence we see more tech people getting

this Visa I'm not saying a marketing or

finance major will not get it but when

you're talking of numbers the higher

numbers are obviously Tech related H got

it got it so uh if I'm a software

engineer basically so basically I need

to be an engineering professional but I

heard also doctors are are able to get

it easily yes so doctors it's a

completely different uh route right so

for doctors uh one thing is you need to

give us M if you've studied in India if

you are going and studying in the US

it's totally a different ball game

doctors typically get a J1 Visa or H1B

which is Cap exempt so for doctors if

they're working in certain hospitals not

all but certain hospitals they can get

an H1B easily but if you've done medical

here in India or anywhere outside us

then you need to clear that State's

USMLE exam H so you're saying if you're

a medical professional wanting to come

to the US there is a special route and

there is no like Lottery system and cap

exemption it is just about your

qualification if you meet the required

qualifications you can come because

there's a bigger shortage of medical

Prof absolutely okay so the odds of

getting a us work visa is reducing more

and more so as somebody who is in India

right now and let's say I apply for a US

college and I get an admit and the fee

is $100,000 a year and my chance of

getting a work visa after 2 years of

working there is now less than 10%

correct so obviously I need to have a

plan B corre so what is Plan B for

example um I had spoken about the

teacher jobs that I spoke last time

there's a tremendous teacher shortage in

the US so if somebody chooses to become

a school teacher then they will not be

subject to a H1B Lottery provided they

are getting into certain schools so such

people I can help them get a teacher

certification done just like a doctor

will need a us mle uh exam similarly to

become a teacher you need to be a

certified teacher so I help people get

that and then they can get an H1B

without the lottery so this is one

example so we can create we can come up

with Solutions where depending on what

he has studied read what education they

have we can suggest how to uh still

remain in the US without getting thrown

out so right now how many nris are there

in India right now because from what I

know is about 1% of someone of American

population is NIS easily possible so

that is about 30 lakh people okay let us

say uh half of them already have the

citizenship half of them don't so about

10 15 lakh people in the US who are

Indians looking to get a green card now

the green card cost right now until

Trump changes the rules is $800,000

which is about 78

CR so what is the solution for them so

as I said I can help you get a

collateral free loan of up to $400,000

from us itself so basically what happens

is a developer is constructing let's say

a project worth $300 million out of

which we bring 100 people together each

put 800 800,000 in a pot now this is $80

million so we go to the developer and

say Hey you are constructing something

over 300 million here is $80 million

loan okay against the property

collateral so now we have the collateral

from the developer hence peace of mind

so it's sort of like investing into real

estate yes you are but you don't get

real estate to own the developer what

he's doing is he'll give you interest of

0.25% now if a developer uses bank money

he can get from 5% at 5% from the bank

huh but to save that cost he's giving

you

25% and that's his profit for 5 years

and then then he returns the money after

that and then he returns the money AA

that's the deal and then it's a bullet

payment or how does it happen no one

stroke no after 5 years one shot I get

the money back you get the money back he

doesn't give like in monthly payment no

no in one stroke so basically I have to

wait for 5 years and then I get the

money back correct and all contracts are

in place everything is back and isn't

there any no risk in this there is risk

is so Evy law says that the money has to

be at risk okay whe has be That's the

Law so if anybody gives you writing that

you will get this money back guaranteed

you will not get the green card you'll

get the money so what we do as a

consultant my job is to make sure that

the projects are right you know the if

the developer has said I have started

construction I go so when I say I go to

us two three times a year actually go

and check so even if it is a trump

project or a kusher project I will

demand them that I would like to see

your construction and they show very

Happ so you're telling me that for

$800,000 I can get that eb5 program and

get a US green card and I don't even

have to have that $800,000 UPF front so

if I have $400,000 with me the remaining

$400,000 can come from a lending company

which will give me at 4 and a half 5%

interest rate and then this $800 entire

$800,000 kind of goes to a project let's

say it's a real estate developer and 5

years later he returns all the money

back to me which I used to repay the

lender and during that time of 5 years I

don't pay the full Emi I only pay the

interest component of the loan so 5 5%

of $400,000 is just $20,000 a year so

just by spending like $20,000 a year

which is like 16 lakh rupees for 5 years

I can get my us green card yes and how

much uh money should I be having as a

safety Factor like who would you

recommend this someone to like if I have

let's say 10 crores with me would you

recommend this to somebody who has just

10 cres to invest 8 crores to in this

program and like have that money people

with no money have taken full money on

loan and doing it really yeah because

dream is so big Sharon because they they

see that their child will get a green

card and this is the only hope and the

child's future will be much nicer and

better so people with zero money taking

full loan and doing this you've seen

this yes I'm doing such cases wow and

when I'm saying zero money not zero but

they def

have a CR not even a CR wow um if I've

gotten the H1B Visa am I guaranteed to

get a green card eventually or how does

it work like can I go ahead and start

building my life get married have kids

and buy a house there is it okay you can

do all of that the only problem is H1B

to Green Card is a eb2 category

application which takes about 40 to 50

years to clear okay so so many Indians

have applied so this is a wait for

Indians normal people get in a year and

a half or two years uh from other other

countries but Indians and Chinese we are

so large in number now the only thing is

people are very scared that what happens

if the eb5 is scrapped and then 5

million the only thing is there is still

time and if somebody comes to us and

takes a consultation we can guide them

that how in the next 3 to 6 months if

they file for the eb5 they can still get

the green card at $800,000 price point

so tell me this if I never get the green

card is it theoretically possible to

live in the US indefinitely by just

renewing my H1B Visa yes and no so

technically if you have a i140 approval

that means you have applied for eb2

category green card it will take 50

years but in 2 2 and a half years you

get the i140 approval after that the law

of 6 years of H1B so the original Law is

you can maximum stay in the US for 6

years then you have to leave after one

year come back on a fresh H1B that's the

normal law but you have the if you have

the 14 i140 approval then you can renew

H1B indefinitely and live in the US for

for 10 20 30 40 years but if you get

laid off then within 2 months you have

to find a job that to a job which will

sponsor your H1B otherwise you have to

leave so the the the company has a lot

of power they have the gun to your head

absolutely right absolutely so the so

nobody can guarantee yes so that's the

reason people want to get the green card

because once you get the green card

whether you get laid off you're sitting

at home chilling doing nothing

everything is allowed got it so what

what about U my my kids let's say I have

a H1B Visa in the US and obviously I get

married I have kids do the kids

automatically become a US citizen or

right now I think Trump is sort of

playing around with those rules as well

he's trying to but today the child will

be a US citizen and frankly it will be

very difficult for Trump to change that

because it's a constitutional right

correct see passing a law and scrapping

is a different thing changing the

Constitution is a whole different ball

game so it will be very very difficult

almost impossible for him to make that

change so I can have kids in the US if

even if I don't have a green card and

then once they turn 21 they can sponsor

you oh really what is that tell me if

they are so any child who is a citizen

or anybody who's a US citizen and after

age of 21 they can sponsor the parents

what does that mean sponsor sponsor

means get them a green card and that'll

be easy faster yeah but what faster 21

years 21 years have to wait but still

you're saying the other green card is 40

years waiting through myself so the

better way have quits quickly

21 years they'll become and then they

can sponsor me you have a brilliant plan

you don't need me for any kind of

consultation guys I'm all about hacks

got it so okay so let's say now I'm um

I've I've come to the US I've uh I'm

studying here what are those things that

I can do as a student uh studying in the

US College which can increase my

likelihood of getting Visa like what are

the things that I can do as a student

okay frankly the H1B is a lottery now

there is an additional quota for masters

in PhD additional 20,000 so 65,000 is

the lottery amount or the quota for

everybody and additional 20,000 so total

85,000 h-1bs they give so Masters and

phds can reapply or can automatically

get repick in the 20,000 quota but again

most of the people who go from India

they are going for Masters very few I

mean now there are still good numbers

going for Bachelors M but the higher

number of let's say 800,000 people when

I'm saying they applied for the H1B

Lottery out of out of it 600,000 easily

will be Masters and above okay so

frankly as a student there is no hack

that you can do that your name will get

picked in the lottery yes you need to

have a good profile everything so that

you will get a good job and the company

will file for your H1B it's easier to

get a job using networking compared to

people come to me saying I've sent 500

rums but no reply

it's just one of those thousands of

resumes that companies receive right but

networking is a fabulous tool and you

can definitely use it give me some

networking hacks that a student

listening to this can use so there are

so many uh corporate events happening

where Outsiders are allowed we used to

go and participate thankfully our

University they would actually send out

an email to us saying this event is

happening that event and that's local

event you don't need to take a flight

and go every city has some event or the

other it could be cultural event it need

not be a company event right it's about

just making some connection yes because

you never know which next Company CEO

CFO you might just meet casually now

tell me today what is the trend that

you're seeing are there a lot of Indian

students going to the US for the

four-year bachelor degree and what are

those fields that they're going after

and what are those colleges that you

know that they're going for so the trend

has absolutely changed I am myself

shocked too many people for are going to

the US for undergrad any numbers that

you can sh no it's very difficult to

come up with numbers okay but I know

that lot of people with money now

suddenly are sending their kids to the

US how much how much money do you need

to sort of send your kid for an

undergrad degree so typically $ 50,000

to $100,000 per anom depending on

University if it's a State University

it's little less if it's a private

university it's more uh plus of course

the living expense and you know all

other expenses so about $300 to

$400,000 easily for easily easily okay

right so it's not cheap it's not cheap

okay right now anybody who's going to us

to study they would want to stay there

permanently

now if somebody goes on Master on a

master's degree program then typically

their age is 21 or above so Sur these

kids who are studying undergrad in the

US there is a very interesting advantage

that they have they are at the age of 18

or 19 okay and the eb5 Green Card law

says that if a family uh applies that

means husband wife and kids under 21

applies for the Green Card everybody

gets it so that's a very big Advantage

no wait so what I understand is if if I

have a 15 16y old kid right and I want

to send this kid to the US for his

undergrad correct right and let's say

they're studying either computer science

engineering for 4 years or whatever that

degree may be now parall me and my wife

will apply for a eb5 Visa correct and in

a couple of years both of us get green

card and automatically my kid also gets

green card because they're under 21 yes

interesting so we've heard a lot about

the rootes and strategies that people

follow but what are some of the mistakes

or pitfalls that people usually do due

to which they get blacklisted Visa gets

rejected and they get kicked out of the

country so what are these things that

Indians are doing in the US which

they're not supposed to do so Indians

have been doing this a lot for many

years but now president Trump has taken

it very seriously so a lot of people

have come to me saying my kid you know

or some I I heard it in the news that uh

he was doing uh studies on student visa

and he was thrown out now just because

you are studying doesn't mean that

everything is right there are a lot of

children who then work outside the

campus illegally which they should not

be doing they accept cash and they think

that they'll never get caught got it

very interesting so all said and done

Dees what you're saying is that if you

can sort of get the Visas and if you're

very very lucky us is still the

destination for the best chance of

upward mobility of wealth compared to

the rest of the world absolutely and you

are the expert who helps with the Visas

so any last piece of advice to our

audience who wants to move to the US or

uh yeah yeah basically who wants to move

to the US any last piece of advice so

the only advice I want to give to people

who are considering eb5 especially

people who are on either student visas

or H1B in the US is don't wait forever

next 3 months you better plan and the

best thing is to start so let's say you

don't have the money right away you can

figure it out you know in next 3 4

months I'll get the money but you don't

have the money I will recommend that you

get a consultation with a US immigration

attorney and start the process start the

paperwork cool Dees I think this was

very very informative I think a lot of

our audien's minds and eyes have opened

about the possibilities that is there uh

obviously the time is running out in

terms of going for your us dream whether

uh uh you believe in the US dream or not

guys there is definitely a land of

opportunities over there in terms of

higher pay I've seen it I know my

friends who are living and working there

making insane amounts of money so I hope

this was an informative session for you

uh about learning about the nitty-gritty

details about what exactly does it take

to go to the US on that note guys I'll

see you in the next one

[Music]
