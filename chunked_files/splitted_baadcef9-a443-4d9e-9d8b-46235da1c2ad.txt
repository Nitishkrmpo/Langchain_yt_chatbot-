chunk 0 : - An Air India Boeing 787 took off

for what should have

been a routine nine-hour flight,

but then ended up

crashing into buildings

just half a minute after departure. (plane booms)

Why?

chunk 1 : What actually happened? Well, I will get to the details

from the interim report soon,

but first I want to talk

about the period leading up

to its release

on the 11th of July, 2025. Unfortunately, in the immediate

aftermath of this tragedy,

there were no real updates

from the investigators,

which frankly isn't that surprising

given how much they had to do

and how careful they needed to be

in weighing the information. But this also meant

that there was

a substantial information vacuum,

which gave rise to wild speculation

or even worse, real trash

in the form of deliberate misinformation

that a very large section of the public

just wasn't equipped to

distinguish from the truth. For example, several fake

interim reports were circulated

and one of them claimed

that the captain's seat

had slipped or fallen backwards,

causing him to inadvertently

pull back on the thrust

levers without even realizing it. Now that actually did happen

to an Air India Express flight,

a Boeing 737-800, which

I covered in a different video. But that also meant

that these hoaxsters

were now using a mix of AI tools

and real stories to create narratives

that initially

looked really believable,

thanks to details

from that older story

and its final report. Now I know that not everyone

can quickly identify these scams. They are designed

to deceive and they really do. And in events like this,

it's always important

to turn to reliable sources

and to think critically,

especially when you see

something really shocking

being sent to you

from a friend or colleague. Since at least some

of this fabricated material

is based on real events and reports,

it looks super convincing,

even to industry insiders

and that just makes my blood boil. Not only do we have

a horrible tragedy on our hands,

the first fatal crash of a Boeing 787

and the deadliest crash in a decade,

no, we also have people

knowingly spreading AI-generated nonsense

just to get some temporary attention

or for some other nefarious motives. That is actually a big

part of why my team and I

have been following this story closely

and making frequent video

updates for you guys,

and I hope you appreciate that. But now, finally, we

have a preliminary report,

and while it still doesn't include

any definitive conclusions,

it sheds a lot of light

on what happened. So this video is

all about the facts here,

what we do know and what it means,

and also what we don't know,

which is just as important.

chunk 2 : And it's also about

what you can do from now on

to remain well informed. This tragedy happened

on Thursday the 12th of June, 2025,

involving Air India Flight 171

from Ahmedabad to London's

Gatwick Airport in the UK. Until this tragic event,

Flight 171 was a daily service

for Air India, departing

early in the afternoon.

chunk 3 : And on this day,

the aircraft had been scheduled

to depart at 1310 local time. The flight's captain

was a 56-year-old male

who had a total flight

experience of 15,638 hours,

and nearly 8,600 hours

was on the Boeing 787,

of which 8,260

was as pilot-in-command. Now, earlier local news reports said

that he was also

a line-training captain

with Air India and that he

planned to retire soon,

but that was not

mentioned in the report. His first officer was 32 years old

and had a total flight

experience of 3,403 hours,

of which 1,128 hours were

flown on the Boeing 787. And it's important to

note here that for this flight,

the first officer was pilot flying

and the captain was pilot monitoring. As part of their pre-flight preparation,

the two pilots underwent

some medical checks,

including a breath analyzer test,

which showed that they were both fit

to operate the flight over to Gatwick. Both pilots also seemed

to have gotten adequate rest

before the flight,

according to the report. One of the speculations we heard

before the preliminary

report was released

was that the aircraft might

have been carrying something

that could have affected

the instruments on board,

but the load manifest showed

that there were no dangerous

goods on board this flight. Anyway, the pilots' fuel calculations,

the rest of the loadsheet

as well as the V-speed calculations

didn't raise any flags

for the investigations either. Everything was apparently

within allowable limits. Once the crew were ready,

they taxied out for departure

about half an hour behind schedule

towards Runway 23. Now, Ahmedabad only has one runway,

and its parallel taxiway doesn't run

all the way to the

threshold for Runway 23. And this meant that the

crew had to taxi out

and enter the runway

from taxiway Romeo four,

which is connecting close

to about halfway down the runway. Now, initial ADS-B data

of the plane's taxi route

was missing quite a lot of data points,

which also created

some initial controversy,

where some suspected that the crew

might have tried to take off from

that intersection taxiway, Romeo Four

but later reporting,

and, of course,

this preliminary report confirmed

that the 787 did not take off

from that midfield position. Instead, the flight crew backtracked

to the threshold of the 3,505-meter,

or 11,500 feet long runway,

and then made a full length takeoff. Now Ahmedabad Airport is only 58 meters

or 189 feet above sea level,

but at the time of their departure,

the high temperature

of around 37 degrees Celsius,

or 98.6 Fahrenheit,

meant that the density altitude

was around 3,200 feet. This requires a bit extra

performance from the aircraft,

but nothing that the Boeing 787

and its mighty GEnx engines

couldn't handle on this day. And, of course, these are conditions

that crews flying in and out of India

would have been entirely familiar with. The crew started their takeoff roll

at time 0807 and 37 seconds UTC,

and then reached

their V1 decision speed

just under a minute later,

which would be

considered completely normal

for their takeoff weight. The plane's weight on

wheel switches then indicated

that they lifted off at time

0808 and 39 seconds. And initially, all videos

taken from this event showed

that they achieved

a normal positive rate of climb. But very soon, these

same videos then showed

that this climb flattened out

and then quickly turned into a descent,

one that the aircraft

then never recovered from. - The Air India incident

that Petter's covering here

is one of the most

shocking aviation events

in recent memory. And since then,

the preliminary report

has been released,

bringing some surprising

and important updates.

chunk 4 : With over 300

articles covering the story,

we needed a clearer,

unbiased view of the events,

so we turned to Ground News. It helped us cut through the noise

and you can follow along too

at ground.news/mentour. Right away, it's clear that about 30%

of the coverage

comes from media conglomerates

and only about 10% comes

from independent sources. And what stands out

to me in the coverage

of the Air India incident

is how differently outlets

choose to frame the story. Some focus on individual responsibility

or emotional angles

while others emphasize procedures,

diplomacy or tech details. It shows how left

and right-leaning sources

often highlight different aspects based

on their audience

and editorial approach. Importantly, Ground News

indicates the factual accuracy

of each source, allowing us

to filter by those we trust,

which is ideal for

stories of this complexity. There's even a custom

Mentour feed with all the aviation,

Boeing and tech news that I cover. And if you're tired

month for a limited time. Thanks to Ground

News for sponsoring this. Now, let's get back to the video. - Now, I'll come back to

the findings in this report soon,

but first let's look

at some of the speculation

that we all heard

immediately after the event. For example, initially there was

a big focus on the flaps. - The flaps were not down. - One theory being that the crew

might not have set them

correctly for the takeoff. We now know for a

fact that this didn't happen. The flaps were correctly set. And, in fact, that mistake

would have been

a really difficult one to make

in today's aircraft since several

of our pre-departure

checklists include these flaps

and those checklists

are electronic on the 787. And on top of that,

the aircraft also knows

where the flaps should

be and therefore,

will warn the pilots

if they're not set correctly. Now the point I want to make here

is that with the low resolution

videos that we first saw,

seeing if the flaps were actually set

was really, really difficult. Even with good

resolution pictures or videos,

the slats might be

a little bit more visible,

but you have to look

very closely to be able

to tell how the

trailing edge flaps are set. You see, one of the things

the 787 is famous for

is its carbon fiber

composite fuselage and wings. And the fact that carbon

fiber is much less prone

to fatigue cracking also means

that they can be very flexible and thin,

making them more efficient. The Boeing 787-8 has two flap settings

commonly used for takeoff,

flaps five and flaps 15. And with flaps five, which

we now know that these pilots

were using for this takeoff,

the leading edge flap surfaces,

the slats, extend

and the trailing edge flaps

also extend rearwards,

but they droop down only slightly,

which is why they are so hard to see. The next point

that got people's attention

were the engines,

and there was an

early reason for that,

especially after the circulation

of a better quality version

of a video where a buzzing

noise could clearly be heard,

which led a lot of people to believe

that the Ram Air Turbine,

or RAT, had been deployed. Again, it's almost impossible

to see the RAT in the videos,

it's the size of a propeller

of a small general aviation aircraft,

but it would be spinning

fast in the slipstream,

causing that very characteristic noise. Its mast and door would

be somewhat easier to see,

but not from the rear and at

the resolution of these videos. However, like I said,

it is possible to distinguish

the noise from the RAT,

and other CCTV footage

that we didn't get access to initially,

but that was included

in the preliminary report,

showed that the Ram Air Turbine

or RAT did indeed deploy,

while the aircraft was

still in its initial climb. The investigation also clarified

that there was no

significant bird activity

close to the aircraft,

which might have affected

the aircraft's engines,

but obviously the RAT's deployment

meant that there was a lot

of focus on the engines

and what might cause

them to lose power. Now, there are many reasons

why the RAT can deploy,

and many of them does

not involve a dual engine failure,

as Ben and I have discussed

in our previous podcast

over on the Captains Speaking

podcast channel,

but one point worth highlighting here

is that a dual-engine failure

is not only extremely rare,

it is also practically impossible

for both engines to fail

at the exact same time

due to most technical faults. That's important to understand,

because like I said earlier,

we could see in one of the videos

that the plane rotated,

and initially started to gain

altitude for several seconds,

which means that it definitely

did have power to begin with. But unless it lost power

from both engines

at more or less exactly the same time,

we should be able to

see a distinctive yawing movement

when it happened. The engines are quite

far apart out on the wings,

and losing one means

that it will suddenly

generate a lot of drag,

while the other engine

would obviously

still be producing thrust,

and that asymmetric

thrust should be visible. Now, even with something

like fuel contamination,

which could affect both engines,

dual failures at the same time

are practically impossible. And yet, we saw no such

yaw on any of those videos,

or any obvious signs

of a technical engine trouble,

like smoke coming out

of one of them or surges. But there is also

a small caveat to this. The Boeing 787 is

a very modern airliner,

complete with a fly-by-wire system,

and that system is actually designed

to automatically

compensate for asymmetric thrusts

using the rudder and the rest

of its controls if necessary. The aircraft will even move

the rudder pedals

when it does this to let

the pilots know what it is doing. So, in theory at least,

that could explain why we

can't really see any momentary yaw

in the videos if the aircraft lost power

from its engines at different times. Another point worth mentioning

here is the landing gear. Like most widebody aircraft,

the 787 has main gear legs

that are equipped with trucks or boogies,

which means that

each leg has four wheels,

two front and two rear. The preliminary report shows

that the landing gear lever was found

in the down and locked position,

and there is no

mentioning of the lever

being moved during the

entire accident sequence. Now, that is interesting,

because when the landing

gear is down and locked,

the rear pair of the wheels

on each boogie sits

lower than the front pair. But before the gear can be retracted,

the mechanism rotates the boogie

so that the front pair of the wheels

drops lower than the rear,

and that's to allow the wheels

to fit better into the wheel well base

at the bottom of the fuselage. Now, normally, when the

boogies do this rotation,

the main gear doors open

at pretty much the same time. And in at least one of the videos,

the boogies seem to be rotated

and the front wheel sits lower

than the rear wheels on each leg,

but the main

gear doors remain closed. Now, we don't know

why this happened,

if the gear retraction

sequence actually was initiated

and not mentioned in the interim report,

or if that gear position

is a visual illusion of some sort. The 787 does include

a lot of automation

for its electrical

and hydraulic systems,

all of which could have affected

what we saw without

any action from the pilot. So we likely won't

know the answer to that

until the final report comes out.

chunk 5 : But let's now see what we

actually do know

from this interim report. We first learned that the investigation

was focusing on the

fuel cutout switches,

thanks to an article by Jon Ostrower

in The Air Current

from the 8th of July. Now, by the way, The Air Current

is one of the most

important aviation insider sources

that my team and I use for

our Mentour Now!

chunk 6 : channel.

chunk 7 : And they are extremely sensitive

about misinformation and speculation,

so we knew that they wouldn't

publish something like this

without having good sources. Now, the fuel cutout

switches are located

on the central pedestal behind

the two thrust levers,

and we pilots normally

manipulate them on the ground,

either to start the

engines before a flight

or to shut them down

after we stop at the gate. They are located where they are

within easy reach of each of the pilots

because they also form part

of several important

emergency checklists

like engine fire, severe damage

or separation for example,

where we quickly might need

to cut the fuel to the

burning or damaged engine. Now, after that initial

reporting from The Air Current,

sure enough, the

preliminary report did show

that at time 0808 and 42 seconds,

just three seconds

after Air India Flight 171

had become airborne,

the fuel cutout switches

of first engine number one,

then a second later,

engine number two

suddenly transitioned

from run to cutoff. As Ben and I have explained

in another live podcast,

there are a couple of features designed

in these switches to

make sure that nobody

can bump or move them accidentally.

chunk 8 : First, there are two big ears poking out

of the pedestal on

either side of the switches

to shield them from

any accidental bumping. And secondly, the

switches themselves

can't simply be flipped back and forth. No, to move them, you

first need to pull upwards,

then pivot the switch

over into a new position

and then release it into its new notch. This is a well-proven design. Other switches in Boeing cockpits work

in very much the same way,

like the landing gear lever for example,

which also needs to be pulled out

and then rotated and released. Now, I should mention

that the preliminary report

also highlights an FAA

Special Airworthiness

Information Bulletin,

or SAIB, that was

released back in 2018. That bulletin involved

the locking feature

of the fuel

control switches like these,

but ones that were

installed on Boeing 737s. And the bulletin said

that some of these switches

were apparently installed

with the locking feature disengaged

or not up to standard. But that was, however, not considered

an unsafe condition by the FAA,

and even though an inspection

of these switches was recommended,

it was never made mandatory. The interim report states

that Air India had

not made this voluntary inspection

of this particular aircraft,

but it's important to point out here

that there are no reports

in the history of this aircraft

showing any critical problems

with these specific switches. On top of that,

the report also points out

that the fuel control module

that includes these

switches was replaced

on this aircraft twice

after this SAIB was issued,

once in 2019 and again in 2023,

for reasons that had nothing to do

with the fuel control switches. Now, I really want

to stress that at this point,

we do not know how

or why these switches were moved,

but we know that one

of the pilots did ask the other,

why did he cut off? And the other pilot replied

that he did not do so. Those statements will be

the subject of a lot of scrutiny

by the investigation going forward,

but at the moment it can be interpreted

in two different ways. One that the pilots did,

in fact, not move the switches,

but the other that one of them did

but just didn't own up to it. In any case, the aircraft

did as it was told. Fuel to the engines

was immediately cut off,

and the engines

quickly started rolling back. And that obviously was what triggered

the release of the

Ram Air turbine in the back,

which I mentioned earlier. Then, at a time 0808

and 52 seconds,

10 seconds after

the fuel control switches

were moved to cut off,

someone then moved the

engine one switch back to run,

and four seconds later also

the switch for engine number two. At the same time,

the aircraft automatically

initiated the start

of its auxiliary power unit,

the APU, to give the

aircraft some extra electrical power. But unlike the Ram Air turbine,

which started supplying the aircraft

with hydraulics just five seconds

after it was deployed,

the APU likely never

had time to come online. However, some other systems in the 787

were working to save the aircraft

and its passengers and crew. When the fuel cut-off

switches are moved back to run

and the plane is in flight,

the engine electronics

automatically attempt

to relight the engines

as soon as possible. So that was what now happened. The flight data recorder showed

that the exhaust gas temperatures, or EGT,

for both engines now started rising. Engine number one,

whose switch was restored first,

stopped its deceleration

and started to recover. Engine number two was a bit slower,

but in any case, by this point,

it was already too late. 13 seconds after the first

engine switch was moved to run,

one of the pilots made a Mayday call,

whose exact wording

was not quoted in the report. And just another six seconds later,

the aircraft hit the northeast

wall of a nearby building

with an estimated nose-up

angle of about eight degrees. When it did so, it quickly disintegrated,

with pieces of its fuselage,

wings and engines

subsequently hitting

four more buildings around,

and its enormous fuel load caught fire. All but one of the plane's 242 occupants,

plus 19 people on the ground,

lost their lives in the crash,

and many more on the ground

were seriously injured. So where do we go from here then?

chunk 9 : Well, again, this is

a preliminary investigation report,

which is intended only

as a factual account of what happened. We will know the full story

when the final report is released,

likely in a year or two from now. Until then, I would really

recommend everyone

to try to stay clear of

speculation around the Boeing 787,

Air India and everything else here,

until the investigation comes

with actionable safety actions to take,

because only then can we be sure

that all of the different angles

have been taken into account. Now like I said in the beginning,

the early information vacuum

on this accident meant

that people started looking

in the most unlikely places

for any type of information. Cabin entertainment system

that doesn't work on the ground,

or air conditioning systems

that aren't running

immediately after boarding

can be really frustrating for sure,

but these systems are often separate

from what we pilots

consider in the cockpit

and what we need for a safe flight,

and they seldom offer any clues

about what caused

an accident like this. Now when it comes to misinformation,

there are a few clues to

look for in order to see them. The very first hoax reports

came within days of the crash,

adding that a final report

would be ready within a

coming couple of days,

and that would obviously

be utterly impossible. So if you see reports like this,

have a look at the dates

and see if they make sense. Again, this is the worst

aviation accident

in the last decade, and attention on it

could remain very high for weeks

and months, and rightly so. Understandably, Boeing took

this matter very seriously,

effectively pulling out of

the Paris Air Show in June

to help assist the investigation

in any way that they could. But here I should also

point out that at least

as we are recording this,

we haven't heard Boeing

releasing any safety bulletins

or the FAA publishing

any airworthiness directives

on the Boeing 787, and there were also

no such indications

in the interim report. This suggests that

even though the investigation

is slowly focusing

on specific systems,

this accident is likely not related

to a design problem with the aircraft. But that's where

we need to draw the line

between speculation and information. India's Aircraft Accident

Investigation Bureau have support

from the NTSB, the FAA

and from Britain's

Air Accident Investigation Branch,

and by the way, this preliminary report

was far more detailed

than many had expected,

which I am super, super happy to see. It is refreshing to

see that kind of openness

and transparency, which is

exactly what we need

in order to learn

from tragedies like this.
