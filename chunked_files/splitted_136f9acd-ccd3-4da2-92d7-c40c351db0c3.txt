Often in this world we meet strangers We

often meet strangers In this world we

meet on unknown paths We get lost but we are

always remembered

Often in this world we meet strangers We get lost on

meeting on unknown paths

But we are always remembered

Often in this world

[Music] The

eyes speak, the

heartbeat is also with us No

one should understand this is the

language of love The eyes speak, the heartbeat is also with us No

one should understand this is the language of love Slowly

slowly they settle in the heart Slowly slowly they

settle in the heart

They steal the heart secretly Then one day they get

separated

Often in this world

Tarat This heart to love is demanding a

true dildar, I don't know

where to find love This heart to love is demanding a true

dildar, I don't know where to find love

When lovers meet on such nights When on such

nights  I meet lovers, our eyes meet and

then our hearts beat faster, stories of love are created,

often in this world,

in this world, strangers meet, we meet,

on unknown paths we get lost,

but I always remember them, but I

always remember them, but I always remember them,

but I always remember them, yes,

often in this world

What should I tell you about my pain,

what should I tell you about my pain, it

comes in your dreams and snatches away your sleep,

this thing which you talk about as comfort, it is

seen on the way

and snatches away your peace,

you love your conscience a lot,

friend, you love your

conscience a lot, so stay away from her area, I have heard that

she promises to meet and snatches away your faith,

you live very peacefully,

Majnu, you have

not met Majnu, perhaps those who

tell her tell her, she embraces you

and snatches away your life, those who tell her

tell her, she embraces you

and snatches away your life
