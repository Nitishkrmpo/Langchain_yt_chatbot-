00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:41.995
Coming Up..

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:04.673
Hello This is Sarthak &amp; Welcome to India's first weekly News show. The Sunday Show.

00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:07.791
The show where we discuss News with Entertainment.

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:13.928
New Movie of Diljit Dosanjh was released casting Hania Amir &amp; Neeru Bajwa.

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:16.915
The poster of which looks first copy of The singh is king.

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:19.743
Not kidding, just look at it once.

00:01:19.743 --> 00:01:21.336
But that's not the point

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:26.091
Controversy erupted due to a Pakistani actress Hania Amir

00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:29.607
She shouldn't be in the movie after Pahalgam &amp; Operation Sindoor

00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:32.648
Due to this Diljit got ab*sed online. 

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:53.319
You made your point but what was the need to say Halkat?

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:05.499
Although Diljit clarified that Movie was shot long back in February

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.848
We haven't released the movie in India &amp; Money of producer is involved.

00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:12.465
And art unites us all etc etc.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.452
Now what makes it more complicated is..

00:02:14.452 --> 00:02:18.973
Some Nationalist people alleged diljit to be an Anti National in past.

00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:23.860
Seems he was sure about backlash that after the release he'll get abus*d

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.521
Personally I believe neither it should be released now nor in future too.

00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:33.816
Alright Movie was shot earlier and it's not getting released in India but..

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:36.376
Let's admit it, you would not be able to release too.

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:42.199
This argument doesn't make sense When the wound is fresh &amp; Deep, and the nation is united

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.090
When someone lose their lives then how can you give financial argument?

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.312
But you know, money isn't everything, especially when people d!e.

00:02:50.312 --> 00:02:56.481
Let me give you personal example. Earlier we signed so many videos &amp; a project with a coaching institute

00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:00.328
But later some students di*d in an accident there.

00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:05.958
So we cancelled the entire project, several videos were ready but we didn't publish.

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.845
Cancelled all the remaining videos.

00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:10.731
Because again some people lost their lives.

00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:14.535
I believe in such cases, even if no-one ask and you don't take a stand.

00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:17.491
It looks insensitive and it feels immoral

00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:20.593
Too much english.

00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:25.807
There's a Doha of Kabir.Reading many books, the whole world d!ed, but none became truly wise.

00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:29.851
The one who understands the two-and-a-half letters of 'love' is the one who is truly wise.

00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:32.323
An incident from Etawah, UP was in controversy.

00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:39.066
When villagers came to know that a religious Story teller comes from Yadav community not the Brahmin 

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:45.679
So caught him, thr@shed him, sprinkled ur!ne for purification, shove the head.

00:03:58.636 --> 00:04:03.909
Other side said that this guy was misbehaving with women so he was treated like this.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.575
But when you watch the Viral video then you can understand the truth.

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:11.916
Later Akhilesh Yadav met with the victim &amp; said casteism was there.

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:18.192
Villagers protested, Police had to take action &amp; arrest people.

00:04:18.192 --> 00:04:19.813
Basic news covered.

00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:23.417
The issue is casteism.

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:26.677
I won't talk about whether it's Right or Wrong.

00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:28.553
But it's there in the society.

00:04:28.553 --> 00:04:33.306
Discrimination based on the caste is still there in the society.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.706
And it takes place with convenience.

00:04:34.706 --> 00:04:39.510
People those who talk about Hindu Unity on internet have mentioned their caste in the number plate of car.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.622
It emerged out but it happens in  subtle manner.

00:04:43.622 --> 00:04:49.401
If you visit a village then tell a Harijan surname.

00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:52.960
Then behaviour will be changed

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.682
It's nicely depicted in gangs of wasseypur 

00:04:56.682 --> 00:05:00.446
There's a scene in which Sultan goes to meet Ramadhir.

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:04.861
Ramadhir's wife asked to serve food in clay utensils.

00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:09.794
Then a background sound came which said he's musalman so use different utensils.

00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:11.611
This is how discrimination happens in a subtle manner.

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:15.790
Next news is disturbing, you may skip

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.200
Kolkata's RG Kar case didn't even completed an year.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.466
Entire nation was angry, people protested across the country. Culprits got punished.

00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:25.244
But how much have things changed?

00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:27.244
Same city, similar case.

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:34.001
A 24 year law student was r*p*d and the accused were the leader of TMC.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:39.647
Again the details in the FIR so sensitive, neither I can tell Nor you can hear.

00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:44.229
But we can comment on the entire country after taking example of Kolkata &amp; TMC.

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:52.432
Crimes are happening &amp; when the perpetrators got caught so they often found associated with Political parties.

00:05:52.432 --> 00:06:01.262
Every time No political party takes responsibility that how such people joined their Party.

00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:05.305
No political party takes accountability After any incident too

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:10.860
They could be expelled, shamed but no nothing happens. Sometimes leaders start protesting against their own gov

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.091
Next News is from Mumbai, Actress Shefali Jariwala d!ed 

00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.364
Initial reports hint the reason as cardiac arrest.

00:06:20.364 --> 00:06:27.492
Now if you don't know her then she was seen in Big Boss &amp; before that In Kanta Laga

00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:33.917
Kanta Laga was a famous song,There won't be a single wedding where this song isn't played during the procession.

00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:36.488
Like the video, let's move to the next news.

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:42.117
Like Please..why aren't you doing? Later you say that I kept begging for likes

00:06:42.117 --> 00:06:45.355
You guys increase my BP while discussing BP news.

00:06:49.323 --> 00:06:57.218
US travel department issued Level 2 advisory to US citizens travelling to India.

00:06:57.218 --> 00:07:00.378
Travel Advisory as the name suggests is the advisory 

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:05.306
Which a country issues to their citizens travelling to another country.

00:07:05.306 --> 00:07:09.829
For example If you have to visit Saudi so avoid liqu*r, for UAE avoid sharp objects 

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:13.560
If you have to visit Sudan then be careful from Rebel Groups.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.066
If you want to go Pakistan then...

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:19.199
Why do you want to go Pakistan?

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.575
Are you Anju?

00:07:20.575 --> 00:07:25.149
Generally Travel advisor of US is considered as a standard 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:29.196
It's given importance because it's superpower &amp; economic centre.

00:07:29.196 --> 00:07:31.380
Far ahead in information w@rfare.

00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:49.514
R*p* Crimes are increasing rapidly in india 

00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:52.672
Hearing this, it hurt a little, right? Felt a bit ashamed? I did too.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:57.647
But on the same day this news came, there was also news of a r\*pe of a French tourist.

00:07:57.647 --> 00:08:04.338
Whenever a country talks bad about my country then I feel like replying strongly but..

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:08.333
I can speak about democracy index, hunger index and even press freedom index 

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.535
But how can I tell about women safety?

00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:14.024
You can recall the last week's hotel video

00:08:14.024 --> 00:08:20.561
If a girl passes from the market so Boys stare her as if they haven't seen a girl 

00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:22.286
Guys are s**uall* depr*ssed 

00:08:22.286 --> 00:08:26.874
But as long as the v!olence is concerned so roll your advisory 

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:32.558
A country which sees 50k d*a*hs annually due to G*n v!ol*nce don't deserve to comment on us.

00:08:35.517 --> 00:08:39.559
We talked about this in detail in this week's fixing News episode.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.534
The man who is R*p!ng

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:48.369
He knows everything, he has seen news.

00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:53.643
His mother, sister or any other women would have told him

00:08:53.643 --> 00:08:59.160
The one who's r*p!ng knows that it's wrong.

00:09:11.138 --> 00:09:15.901
I'm not saying s*x education but there's lot more things which was taught along with that

00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:18.868
You're saying everyone is aware But I don't think so

00:09:18.868 --> 00:09:23.744
Psychological study on the culprit was done in Nirbhaya case.

00:09:23.744 --> 00:09:30.571
He has seen women as they're there to get beat*n &amp; to cook food.

00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:37.296

If you want to Join Sarthak Janta Party &amp; access exclusive content so link is in Description and pinned comments 

00:10:00.774 --> 00:10:05.731
Listen to another travel related news. You'll stop coming out from home forget about city.

00:10:06.714 --> 00:10:12.433
Proud of Bihar Tej Pratap yadav aka teju bhaiya is going to become a commercial pilot 

00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:18.844
He has qualified the selection process &amp; his training is going to start soon

00:10:18.844 --> 00:10:22.464
Yes Biharis Teju bhaiya is so down to earth &amp; now he'll fly in sky.

00:10:22.464 --> 00:10:27.318
The only thing missing was that he became a pilot but couldn’t join the army.

00:10:32.294 --> 00:10:38.015
I don't doubt on your capabilities. If you were there so Pakistani would have started singing Vande Mataram 

00:10:38.015 --> 00:10:41.126
You'd have thrown Litti on the head of Asim Munir.

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:46.701
Absolutely, these people were taking you lightly

00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:50.341
But don't take it personally. These people aren't bad by heart.

00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:53.380
If I say so they like in a single go.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.916
Do you? You won't become illiterate after giving thumbs up on my video.

00:10:56.916 --> 00:10:59.058
Atleast show some Respect to me in front of Teju bhaiya 

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:02.262
Whoever didn't like should be sit in plane with Him.

00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:09.039
Next news is from Delhi. Petrol &amp; Diesel won't be given on petrol pumps from July 01, 2025.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:14.672
No it's not for all. Later you'll say I'm a mad guy.

00:11:14.672 --> 00:11:16.938
For some certain vehicles

00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:21.065
CAQM told that from 1st July

00:11:21.065 --> 00:11:29.397
Diesel vehicles older than 10 years &amp; Petrol vehicles older than 15 years won't be refueled in NCR

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:32.953
In Modi’s rule, Manmohan’s cars won’t work.

00:11:34.953 --> 00:11:42.781
It's not alone for Delhites, if your vehicle is older so it won't be Refueled in Delhi 

00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:46.905
You think you can get it done so no it's not like that.

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:55.510
ANPR ( automatic number plate recognition)will read your number plate at petrol pump using camera 

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.197
Will read Gujar together on windshield 

00:11:57.197 --> 00:11:59.450
Sorry that's joke from last week.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.752
After Reading number plate it'll be detected that when did you buy the car.

00:12:02.752 --> 00:12:04.680
Nowadays everything is automatic

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:11.106
It'll impact 60 Lakh vehicles in Delhi which includes 41000 two wheelers.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.900
Personally I'm not a big fan of this idea.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.908
Because if petrol pump won't provide then black Marketing will start.

00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:20.636
People will take it in bottles.

00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:24.822
And Delhites are well aware about hiding bottles.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.841
Next news is from Indian Railways 

00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:37.911
Nowadays several changes are happening in Railways. Last week we've seen Tatkal ticket news

00:12:37.911 --> 00:12:41.518
Now railways are going to increase Fares

00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:45.340
New Fares Will be applicable from July 01st

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:51.820
For sleeper class 01 paise per km for AC 02 paisa per km 

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:57.017
No hike for general upto 500 km

00:12:57.017 --> 00:13:01.827
But beyond that they'll have to pay 0.5 paisa per km

00:13:01.827 --> 00:13:08.962
If you are travelling in a sleeper class for 500 km then you need to pay 5₹ extra.

00:13:08.962 --> 00:13:13.071
If you are travelling by AC class then it'll be 10₹ extra for 500 km

00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:20.917
This news has two angles first thing they didn't hike much prices for general classes 

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:23.126
They're exempted upto 500 km

00:13:23.126 --> 00:13:27.907
You might not feel 5-10₹ more in a long journey 

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:31.361
But it affects Many people.

00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:35.833
At individual level 5-10₹ doesn't look big amount but..

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:41.294
At macro level railway will be benefited in crores annually

00:13:41.294 --> 00:13:43.116
Next news is very interesting

00:13:43.116 --> 00:13:46.171
People have dream to buy a house in Metro cities.

00:13:46.171 --> 00:13:51.411
In my own experience Indian society has 2 status symbol

00:13:51.411 --> 00:13:53.061
Car &amp; House.

00:13:53.061 --> 00:13:56.203
If you bought a car which means you've arrived 

00:13:56.203 --> 00:13:58.451
If you bought a house which means you're established.

00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:00.022
People believe so

00:14:00.022 --> 00:14:03.633
Everyone wants to buy a house but how difficult it is?

00:14:03.633 --> 00:14:08.539
TOI analysed the data of NHB ( Nation housing Board) &amp; urban income.

00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:14.449
And published a report on the housing affordability in various Indian capital cities.

00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:17.882
How much does it cost to buy a house?

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:24.854
On an average 1200 sqft house. It's like twice of a cricket pitch.

00:14:24.854 --> 00:14:27.614
State capital and an average size house

00:14:27.614 --> 00:14:33.016
How much time will it take to buy a house for richest 5 percent.

00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:40.041
If a guy is earning 1 Lakh per month &amp; saving 30k

00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:42.919
Many people don't have this much of salary which you'll save.

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:48.889
Still you'll take 15 years in Chandigarh, 35 years in Delhi, 36 years in Bengaluru 

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:54.990
64 years in Gurgaon and A century to buy a single house in Mumbai.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.875
And again this is just the top 5%

00:14:57.875 --> 00:15:01.570
These people can hope 

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:09.348
But the remaining 95% can't even think to buy a house.

00:15:09.348 --> 00:15:11.040
This is the reality 

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.024
Let's talk about giving more money after taking more. But before that let's discuss context 

00:15:16.024 --> 00:15:23.697
Indian government provides funds to Promote regional languages like Tamil, Odia, Telugu etc

00:15:23.697 --> 00:15:29.207
Which is used in Universities, colleges and for scholarship purposes

00:15:29.207 --> 00:15:38.103
Report reveals that Govt spent 2500 crore to promote sanskrit in 10 years.

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:47.087
Which is 17 times more than the remaining 5 classical languages combined

00:15:47.087 --> 00:15:54.335
Sanskrit was allotted 250 Cr annually whereas remaining languages were given 13 cr.

00:15:54.335 --> 00:15:58.791
Focus on Sanskrit due to some obvious reasons which you already know 

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:04.226
Coding is being done using sanskrit in foreign. Don't you know?

00:16:04.226 --> 00:16:07.927
You've forgotten the sanskrit study in 8 th class 

00:16:07.927 --> 00:16:11.367
I got first rank and was rewarded with a plate.

00:16:11.367 --> 00:16:15.391
Ok next two are the Education related news. First is for UPSC aspirants 

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:23.459
Many aspirants prepare for UPSC but very few qualify the interview &amp; become an officer 

00:16:23.459 --> 00:16:26.832
Mostly can't clear and leave out with the academic knowledge 

00:16:26.832 --> 00:16:31.266
To cater those aspirants, Government is bringing a strategic initiative 

00:16:31.266 --> 00:16:37.123
Which will help those students who couldn't qualify the final stage

00:16:37.123 --> 00:16:41.280
An app has been rebranded. Earlier there was a public disclosure scheme

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.303
Which is rebranded as Pratibha setu

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:55.291
Data of those aspirants will be shared with Big private &amp; Govt organisation who qualified written but failed in interview 

00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:58.531
But yes they've potential. They know that knowledge 

00:16:58.531 --> 00:17:02.187
Basically... don't feel bad ORN guys

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:04.285
First copy..

00:17:04.285 --> 00:17:05.243
Sorry 

00:17:05.243 --> 00:17:10.631
Second is from Central Board of Secondary education (CBSE)

00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:16.105
From 2026 onwards, 10 th class kids will have 2 boards exam.

00:17:16.105 --> 00:17:20.835
One will be mandatory and the second will be optional

00:17:20.835 --> 00:17:22.683
Let me tell you its pros and cons

00:17:22.683 --> 00:17:32.108
During our days the performance pressure, getting good grades etc was high now it's reduced after CUET

00:17:32.108 --> 00:17:35.924
It'll reduce more pressure. However it has a problem too

00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:39.960
Which was told by teachers. They told that the logistical problem is..

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:48.882
If you conduct 2 exam in 6 months then there will be logistics issues...when kids will study for one exam

00:17:48.882 --> 00:17:52.397
They'll have to write internal for first then external of first exam. Later they've to write internal for second &amp; external for same

00:17:52.397 --> 00:17:59.070
Kids will be busy in taking exams and how teachers will invigilate or teach

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.662
But listening it for the first time that teachers are afraid of exams 

00:18:03.662 --> 00:18:06.584
Next news is from our parliament 

00:18:06.584 --> 00:18:10.969
On the 50th anniversary of Emergency which was imposed by Indira Gandhi..

00:18:10.969 --> 00:18:16.442
 cabinet passed a resolution to commemorate &amp; honour the sacrifice &amp;  courage of individuals against emergency

00:18:16.442 --> 00:18:20.605
Why are you writing  heavy hindi? These english medium guys may d!e under its weight.

00:18:20.605 --> 00:18:28.983
We often hear about the times of emergency, things were this or that. Our rights were snatched, it was a dark chapter 

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.430
We just hear it because it's 50 year old incident.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.292
Many of us weren't active in politics

00:18:35.292 --> 00:18:36.983
Most of them weren't active in the world.

00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:44.270
Infact the BJP who's commemorating emergency wasn't born then

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.197
But marking 50 years it's good time to talk about emergency 

00:18:48.197 --> 00:18:51.929
Emergency: what? Why? When?

00:18:51.929 --> 00:18:55.627
Why do we call it dark chapter after British rule?

00:18:55.627 --> 00:18:58.782
And that's something we'll see in this spotlight this week.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:09.150
Aandhi 1975, kissa kursi ka 1978, Hazar khwahish 2003

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:14.389
Indu sarkar 2017 and recently emergency in 2025

00:19:14.389 --> 00:19:17.749
These were some movies made on the backdrop of emergency 

00:19:17.749 --> 00:19:21.125
If you haven't watched then let me give the review.

00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:27.492
Under Article 352 , The president can declare emergency when the country has Major security concern.

00:19:27.492 --> 00:19:30.788
Mainly Due to a w*r or a confl!ct or a rebell*on

00:19:30.788 --> 00:19:37.618
Emergency was imposed During indo china and indo pak w*r 1965 &amp; 1971 respectively but in 1975 nothing was there 

00:19:37.618 --> 00:19:43.452
It started 2 years back in 1973. Keshavanand Bharti vs state of Kerala case

00:19:43.452 --> 00:19:49.273
Keshavanand ji challenged Indira Gandhi's reforms 

00:19:49.273 --> 00:19:53.097
Lands were getting snatched by Government after amending right to property

00:19:53.097 --> 00:20:00.295
SC supported Keshavanand ji and said Parliament has authority to amend the constitution 

00:20:00.295 --> 00:20:04.216
But basic structure of the constitution can not be amended 

00:20:04.216 --> 00:20:09.453
Fundamental values like federalism, democracy Can't be amended 

00:20:09.453 --> 00:20:12.172
Can be ignored.

00:20:12.172 --> 00:20:15.675
I'm in your team Sir.

00:20:15.675 --> 00:20:18.135
It's known as basic structure doctrine 

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:21.889
It comes in collegium issue too, you can watch this video 

00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:23.392
Coming back to the point 

00:20:23.392 --> 00:20:28.951
This judgement was given by 13 judge bench &amp; 6 judge supported Indira Government 

00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:33.091
One was A.N. Ray. Later he was made chief justice 

00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:35.235
She was alleged of favouritism 

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:37.221
Now cut to June 1975

00:20:37.221 --> 00:20:44.492
Due to Malpractices Allahabad Highcourt disqualified Indira Gandhi to contest Election

00:20:44.492 --> 00:20:51.842
You may shock that High court stopped then PM to Fight elections

00:20:51.842 --> 00:20:53.629
What are you talking?

00:20:53.629 --> 00:20:57.311
Yes it happened 

00:20:57.311 --> 00:21:01.250
Allahabad Highcourt disqualified her along with Ban to contest elections for Next 6 years.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:07.260
This issue reached to Supreme court &amp; there her people were sitting so they put a partial stay on this judgement.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:13.930
Indira could remain PM but wasn't allowed to vote in parliament.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.508
This was like Toothless tiger or Tigress.

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:21.377
On the other hand the entire country was seeing Student protest against Unemployment &amp; inflation.

00:21:21.377 --> 00:21:23.814
JNU is jobless since then

00:21:23.814 --> 00:21:34.114
On June 25, 1975 Indira Gandhi asked Prez F.A. Ahmed to declare emergency on the ground of internal disturbance

00:21:37.083 --> 00:21:41.458
One thing you should understand that this was a fairly young country 

00:21:41.798 --> 00:21:46.457
It had been around 25-odd years since independence, Indira was the 4th or 5th Prime Minister.

00:21:46.457 --> 00:21:49.910
Indira Gandhi was the powerful leader 

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.910
It's been Said that India is indira and indira is India 

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.275
Today's Aura of Modiji was ...

00:21:58.247 --> 00:22:04.603
Indira Gandhi has her own character Arc when she was daughter of Nehru so she was known as Silent doll 

00:22:04.603 --> 00:22:09.312
When she came in power so imposed emergency and the mastermind behind emergency was this guy..

00:22:09.312 --> 00:22:12.788
Son of Indira, Brother of Rajeev and uncle of Rahul... sanjay Gandhi 

00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:15.745
He was Pilot like Teju Bhaiya 

00:22:15.745 --> 00:22:20.601
When power of Indira was receding so two things were targeted with single thing 

00:22:20.601 --> 00:22:25.875
The way this power gone , similarly she cut the power of Media. But we'll get to that in a bit.

00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:36.644
When her power was receding so she captured Judiciary &amp; Rebels like JP Narayan was jailed 

00:22:36.644 --> 00:22:38.923
Few leaders in Parliament remaining in Tihar

00:22:38.923 --> 00:22:45.039
Legislative which controls executive has controlled Judiciary &amp; Media too

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:52.334
Basically Government suspended article 358 which talks about Freedom of speech, movement etc

00:22:52.334 --> 00:22:58.385
The basic structure which we discussed in Keshavanand case, Art 359 suspends that

00:22:58.385 --> 00:23:00.681
Here Media gone there Judiciary gone

00:23:00.681 --> 00:23:05.086
People were arrested without warrant, you may ask to your grand parents 

00:23:05.086 --> 00:23:07.852
If 2-3 people were seen together so directly they'll land to Jail 

00:23:07.852 --> 00:23:14.475
JP Narayan, L K Advani, Atal Bihari and many other prominent leaders were jailed after imposing MISA act

00:23:14.475 --> 00:23:16.316
Now that's known as UAPA

00:23:16.316 --> 00:23:21.096
Stopping criticism, pressurising media, not doing press conference 

00:23:21.096 --> 00:23:23.483
Asking industrialist to Buy media houses 

00:23:23.483 --> 00:23:26.455
It used to happen that time

00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:29.382
Where do you lose? I'm talking about media

00:23:29.382 --> 00:23:35.021
Foreign media houses like BBC etc were asked either to compromise or leave the country 

00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:39.291
Indian media houses were not able to print the news due to Power cut at printing presses 

00:23:39.291 --> 00:23:46.650
Human connection was also cut by sanjay Gandhi along with Electricity 

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.826
There were also a lot of sterilizations carried out.

00:23:50.816 --> 00:23:56.119
This is democracy, this is dictatorship and this is emergency 

00:23:56.119 --> 00:24:00.487
Imagine if you are a power hungry politician so this is a sweet spot for you 

00:24:00.487 --> 00:24:04.801
Opposition is in jail, media &amp; judiciary is in pocket, citizens have no Rights and you don't need to fight with anyone 

00:24:04.801 --> 00:24:07.824
It Rhymed 

00:24:07.824 --> 00:24:14.192
Since everything was controlled so Indira Gandhi revoked her election disqualification 

00:24:14.192 --> 00:24:16.213
And introduced more amendments 

00:24:16.213 --> 00:24:20.287
This was the time when several students protest took place 

00:24:20.287 --> 00:24:23.602
Leaders like Arun Jaitley and Narendra Modi emerged 

00:24:23.602 --> 00:24:26.978
Advani Ji said about media that

00:24:32.977 --> 00:24:35.309
This all went for 21 Months 

00:24:35.309 --> 00:24:42.880
In 1977 Indira lost badly in the election and Janata party won the election which is today's BJP

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.422
New Government amended the constitution 

00:24:47.422 --> 00:24:55.649
Replaced the word internal disturbance which was misused by Indira Gandhi with ar*ed rebel!on

00:24:55.649 --> 00:24:59.502
Emergency can be imposed today too but the steps have become very complicated 

00:24:59.502 --> 00:25:01.580
Now why is it important to discuss it now?

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:06.532
First I want to maintain my neutrality because I want 8 Lakh from BJP

00:25:06.532 --> 00:25:09.754
Second is to understand the value of democracy 

00:25:09.754 --> 00:25:12.974
Powered state can snatch that easily 

00:25:12.974 --> 00:25:16.536
It's important to have an independent Judiciary and Media

00:25:16.536 --> 00:25:20.604
Citizens go on more risk with the increasing centralisation in democracy 

00:25:20.604 --> 00:25:24.962
Infact when such instances happen in Modi Era..you know about Media 

00:25:24.962 --> 00:25:28.896
When there's conflict with Judiciary and opposition leaders get jailed 

00:25:28.896 --> 00:25:35.255
When dissent gets suppressed, action takes place on tweeting then people say it's an undeclared emergency 

00:25:35.255 --> 00:25:39.634
Now let me tell you another news so that you get context 

00:25:39.634 --> 00:25:43.427
America kept India in Electoral autocracy and I want to say 2 words about Media.

00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:58.911
As per the ritual we read newspaper and we discuss the most interesting articles with you 

00:25:58.911 --> 00:26:02.895
Will discuss two. Which shows me the power of Data

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:11.599
If you have Data of any issue so you can understand nuances and help with better policy making 

00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:15.546
For example we've talked about TFR

00:26:15.546 --> 00:26:18.867
Fertility rate is declining in India. It has come down to 2

00:26:18.867 --> 00:26:24.669
TOI published an article which talks about why population is decreasing in India.

00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:27.767
Why new couples aren't giving birth to more child?

00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:32.324
40% have financial constraints 

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:38.383
They feel they don't have much money to afford education and food expenses of the child

00:26:38.383 --> 00:26:43.498
60% believes that they don't have medical access and reproductive autonomy 

00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:45.865
But when you map the data then you get the most interesting statistics 

00:26:45.865 --> 00:26:48.591
As the education became more accessible ..

00:26:48.591 --> 00:26:54.801
Teenage preg*ancy..like due to child marriage many women used to become mothers in teenage 

00:26:54.801 --> 00:27:00.013
As the awareness increased in the society so the teenage pregn*ncy has reduced 

00:27:00.013 --> 00:27:02.295
As you can see in this Graph 

00:27:02.295 --> 00:27:05.445
That has been reflected in the overall fertility rate 

00:27:05.445 --> 00:27:07.770
Next is related to the health of our countrymen 

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.778
Digestion related diseases have increased 

00:27:10.778 --> 00:27:22.033
Liver related. When the data was mapped so it was found that men have higher disease rate than women

00:27:22.033 --> 00:27:24.957
Women face this problem after the age of 50

00:27:24.957 --> 00:27:27.134
Middle age men are facing this problem at high rate

00:27:27.134 --> 00:27:33.368
When you map area wise then you'll see North eastern states are having higher numbers 

00:27:33.368 --> 00:27:40.717
The problem is in double digit because Liver related problem increases with the consumption of meat &amp; nonveg 

00:27:40.717 --> 00:27:46.173
North eastern states consume more meat &amp; liquor together

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:06.909
This video was Viral this week. Due to sensit!ve nature of the video we had to cover it.

00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:11.455
Vande Bharat express was going from Delhi to Bhopal

00:28:11.455 --> 00:28:15.655
BJP MLA Rajeev Singh was traveling along with his family 

00:28:15.655 --> 00:28:23.313
He asked co passenger Raj Kishore ji to exchange the seat. He denied 

00:28:23.313 --> 00:28:26.630
Both started arguing &amp; Ego of MLA was hurt 

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:30.338
He called and 10-15 go0ns boarded at Jhansi station 

00:28:30.338 --> 00:28:35.893
Go0ns did the same job with Raj Kishore ji which was done to Raj Kapoor in The film Shree 420

00:28:37.862 --> 00:28:41.985
How will you become a go0n ?Vande bharat trains have camera.

00:28:41.985 --> 00:28:49.871
Interestingly when the video went viral so he filed a complaint against Victim for misbehave and mental harrasm*nt

00:28:50.861 --> 00:28:55.557
My fist started paining after beat!ng him my lord.

00:28:55.557 --> 00:29:05.239
When this issue gain traction so BJP did the same which they do everytime when their leaders cross the lines

00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:09.484
Nothing 

00:29:13.483 --> 00:29:19.880
A show cause notice was sent &amp; asked explanation within 7 days.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.924
Public isn't that fool in this country 

00:29:23.924 --> 00:29:28.633
Video is there, eye witnesses are available take action. What will you achieve with show cause notice?

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:31.203
Sorry shaktiman 

00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:39.690
Last week yoga day was celebrated and yoga sessions were celebrated across the nation.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.685
I also did. From 6 AM to 11 AM

00:29:42.685 --> 00:29:48.922
Letaasan. It's tough sometimes your back develop stiffness 

00:29:49.895 --> 00:29:53.391
This video from Vizag went viral 

00:30:04.351 --> 00:30:08.547
After learning spirituality in Yoga people started stealing yoga mats 

00:30:08.547 --> 00:30:12.248
Not 1,2 or 3 . People were running with the entire bundle 

00:30:12.248 --> 00:30:14.473
This was the real excercise
