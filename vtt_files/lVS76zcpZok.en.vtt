00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.568
- An Air India Boeing 787 took off

00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:08.029
for what should have
been a routine nine-hour flight,

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.044
but then ended up
crashing into buildings

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:12.992
just half a minute after departure.

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:14.425
(plane booms)

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:15.774
Why?

00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:16.990
What actually happened?

00:00:18.223 --> 00:00:21.690
Well, I will get to the details
from the interim report soon,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.239
but first I want to talk
about the period leading up

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.607
to its release
on the 11th of July, 2025.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.906
Unfortunately, in the immediate
aftermath of this tragedy,

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.542
there were no real updates
from the investigators,

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:36.658
which frankly isn't that surprising

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:38.340
given how much they had to do

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.890
and how careful they needed to be

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.674
in weighing the information.

00:00:42.573 --> 00:00:43.757
But this also meant

00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:46.725
that there was
a substantial information vacuum,

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:49.490
which gave rise to wild speculation

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.373
or even worse, real trash

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:53.810
in the form of deliberate misinformation

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.926
that a very large section of the public

00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:58.591
just wasn't equipped to
distinguish from the truth.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.459
For example, several fake
interim reports were circulated

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:04.842
and one of them claimed
that the captain's seat

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.109
had slipped or fallen backwards,

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.443
causing him to inadvertently

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.559
pull back on the thrust
levers without even realizing it.

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:15.725
Now that actually did happen
to an Air India Express flight,

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:19.757
a Boeing 737-800, which
I covered in a different video.

00:01:19.757 --> 00:01:21.589
But that also meant
that these hoaxsters

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:23.921
were now using a mix of AI tools

00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:26.856
and real stories to create narratives

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:29.406
that initially
looked really believable,

00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:31.689
thanks to details
from that older story

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:32.855
and its final report.

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.722
Now I know that not everyone

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:37.655
can quickly identify these scams.

00:01:38.173 --> 00:01:41.552
They are designed
to deceive and they really do.

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:44.782
And in events like this,
it's always important

00:01:44.782 --> 00:01:48.464
to turn to reliable sources
and to think critically,

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:50.948
especially when you see
something really shocking

00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:53.379
being sent to you
from a friend or colleague.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.163
Since at least some
of this fabricated material

00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:59.495
is based on real events and reports,

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:01.347
it looks super convincing,

00:02:01.347 --> 00:02:06.446
even to industry insiders
and that just makes my blood boil.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.681
Not only do we have
a horrible tragedy on our hands,

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:13.412
the first fatal crash of a Boeing 787

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:15.696
and the deadliest crash in a decade,

00:02:15.696 --> 00:02:17.495
no, we also have people

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.597
knowingly spreading AI-generated nonsense

00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:22.480
just to get some temporary attention

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.030
or for some other nefarious motives.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.032
That is actually a big
part of why my team and I

00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:30.962
have been following this story closely

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:34.274
and making frequent video
updates for you guys,

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:36.274
and I hope you appreciate that.

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:40.490
But now, finally, we
have a preliminary report,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.907
and while it still doesn't include
any definitive conclusions,

00:02:43.907 --> 00:02:46.724
it sheds a lot of light
on what happened.

00:02:47.173 --> 00:02:50.890
So this video is
all about the facts here,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.257
what we do know and what it means,

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:54.641
and also what we don't know,

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.441
which is just as important.

00:02:56.873 --> 00:02:59.143
And it's also about
what you can do from now on

00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:00.825
to remain well informed.

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:05.789
This tragedy happened
on Thursday the 12th of June, 2025,

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.090
involving Air India Flight 171

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.406
from Ahmedabad to London's
Gatwick Airport in the UK.

00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:15.940
Until this tragic event,
Flight 171 was a daily service

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.342
for Air India, departing
early in the afternoon.

00:03:18.342 --> 00:03:20.476
And on this day,
the aircraft had been scheduled

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:22.941
to depart at 1310 local time.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.490
The flight's captain
was a 56-year-old male

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.740
who had a total flight
experience of 15,638 hours,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.207
and nearly 8,600 hours
was on the Boeing 787,

00:03:34.207 --> 00:03:37.842
of which 8,260
was as pilot-in-command.

00:03:38.924 --> 00:03:41.557
Now, earlier local news reports said

00:03:41.557 --> 00:03:43.557
that he was also
a line-training captain

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.907
with Air India and that he
planned to retire soon,

00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:48.557
but that was not
mentioned in the report.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.707
His first officer was 32 years old

00:03:51.707 --> 00:03:55.807
and had a total flight
experience of 3,403 hours,

00:03:55.807 --> 00:03:59.857
of which 1,128 hours were
flown on the Boeing 787.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.007
And it's important to
note here that for this flight,

00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:05.840
the first officer was pilot flying

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.823
and the captain was pilot monitoring.

00:04:09.342 --> 00:04:11.376
As part of their pre-flight preparation,

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.804
the two pilots underwent
some medical checks,

00:04:13.804 --> 00:04:15.539
including a breath analyzer test,

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.123
which showed that they were both fit

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.940
to operate the flight over to Gatwick.

00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:22.722
Both pilots also seemed
to have gotten adequate rest

00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:25.072
before the flight,
according to the report.

00:04:26.253 --> 00:04:27.786
One of the speculations we heard

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:30.853
before the preliminary
report was released

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:33.886
was that the aircraft might
have been carrying something

00:04:33.886 --> 00:04:36.152
that could have affected
the instruments on board,

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:38.611
but the load manifest showed

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.571
that there were no dangerous
goods on board this flight.

00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:45.155
Anyway, the pilots' fuel calculations,

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:48.271
the rest of the loadsheet
as well as the V-speed calculations

00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:51.221
didn't raise any flags
for the investigations either.

00:04:51.554 --> 00:04:54.270
Everything was apparently
within allowable limits.

00:04:55.588 --> 00:04:56.706
Once the crew were ready,

00:04:56.706 --> 00:04:58.104
they taxied out for departure

00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:00.238
about half an hour behind schedule

00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:02.103
towards Runway 23.

00:05:02.571 --> 00:05:05.255
Now, Ahmedabad only has one runway,

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:07.271
and its parallel taxiway doesn't run

00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:09.837
all the way to the
threshold for Runway 23.

00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:12.472
And this meant that the
crew had to taxi out

00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:15.488
and enter the runway
from taxiway Romeo four,

00:05:15.488 --> 00:05:20.006
which is connecting close
to about halfway down the runway.

00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:24.188
Now, initial ADS-B data
of the plane's taxi route

00:05:24.188 --> 00:05:26.070
was missing quite a lot of data points,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.573
which also created
some initial controversy,

00:05:28.988 --> 00:05:31.289
where some suspected that the crew

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.855
might have tried to take off from

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:36.222
that intersection taxiway, Romeo Four

00:05:36.222 --> 00:05:37.888
but later reporting,

00:05:37.888 --> 00:05:40.673
and, of course,
this preliminary report confirmed

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.838
that the 787 did not take off

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:44.521
from that midfield position.

00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:46.905
Instead, the flight crew backtracked

00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:49.735
to the threshold of the 3,505-meter,

00:05:49.735 --> 00:05:52.569
or 11,500 feet long runway,

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.318
and then made a full length takeoff.

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:59.383
Now Ahmedabad Airport is only 58 meters

00:05:59.383 --> 00:06:01.767
or 189 feet above sea level,

00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:03.668
but at the time of their departure,

00:06:03.668 --> 00:06:06.585
the high temperature
of around 37 degrees Celsius,

00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:10.617
or 98.6 Fahrenheit,
meant that the density altitude

00:06:10.617 --> 00:06:12.769
was around 3,200 feet.

00:06:13.102 --> 00:06:15.568
This requires a bit extra
performance from the aircraft,

00:06:15.568 --> 00:06:17.451
but nothing that the Boeing 787

00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:21.335
and its mighty GEnx engines
couldn't handle on this day.

00:06:21.335 --> 00:06:23.019
And, of course, these are conditions

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.037
that crews flying in and out of India

00:06:25.037 --> 00:06:27.236
would have been entirely familiar with.

00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:29.952
The crew started their takeoff roll

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:33.602
at time 0807 and 37 seconds UTC,

00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:36.387
and then reached
their V1 decision speed

00:06:36.387 --> 00:06:37.784
just under a minute later,

00:06:37.784 --> 00:06:40.034
which would be
considered completely normal

00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:41.518
for their takeoff weight.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.914
The plane's weight on
wheel switches then indicated

00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:49.164
that they lifted off at time
0808 and 39 seconds.

00:06:49.164 --> 00:06:52.094
And initially, all videos
taken from this event showed

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:54.913
that they achieved
a normal positive rate of climb.

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:59.066
But very soon, these
same videos then showed

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:00.615
that this climb flattened out

00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:03.113
and then quickly turned into a descent,

00:07:03.113 --> 00:07:05.695
one that the aircraft
then never recovered from.

00:07:06.898 --> 00:07:09.132
- The Air India incident
that Petter's covering here

00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:11.664
is one of the most
shocking aviation events

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.047
in recent memory.

00:07:13.047 --> 00:07:15.099
And since then,
the preliminary report

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:15.847
has been released,

00:07:15.847 --> 00:07:18.630
bringing some surprising
and important updates.

00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:21.547
With over 300
articles covering the story,

00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:22.948
we needed a clearer,

00:07:22.948 --> 00:07:26.981
unbiased view of the events,
so we turned to Ground News.

00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:28.731
It helped us cut through the noise

00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:32.397
and you can follow along too
at ground.news/mentour.

00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:35.866
Right away, it's clear that about 30%

00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:38.330
of the coverage
comes from media conglomerates

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.481
and only about 10% comes
from independent sources.

00:07:41.997 --> 00:07:43.848
And what stands out
to me in the coverage

00:07:43.848 --> 00:07:45.298
of the Air India incident

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.766
is how differently outlets
choose to frame the story.

00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:51.682
Some focus on individual responsibility

00:07:51.682 --> 00:07:52.998
or emotional angles

00:07:52.998 --> 00:07:54.998
while others emphasize procedures,

00:07:54.998 --> 00:07:56.896
diplomacy or tech details.

00:07:57.316 --> 00:07:59.849
It shows how left
and right-leaning sources

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:02.081
often highlight different aspects based

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:04.331
on their audience
and editorial approach.

00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:08.165
Importantly, Ground News
indicates the factual accuracy

00:08:08.165 --> 00:08:12.248
of each source, allowing us
to filter by those we trust,

00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:14.700
which is ideal for
stories of this complexity.

00:08:14.835 --> 00:08:18.218
There's even a custom
Mentour feed with all the aviation,

00:08:18.218 --> 00:08:20.636
Boeing and tech news that I cover.

00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:23.169

Thanks to Ground

00:08:34.658 --> 00:08:36.443
Now, let's get back to the video.

00:08:37.127 --> 00:08:40.081
- Now, I'll come back to
the findings in this report soon,

00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:42.515
but first let's look
at some of the speculation

00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:45.030
that we all heard
immediately after the event.

00:08:46.063 --> 00:08:49.429
For example, initially there was
a big focus on the flaps.

00:08:49.429 --> 00:08:51.210
- The flaps were not down.

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:52.864
- One theory being that the crew

00:08:52.864 --> 00:08:55.961
might not have set them
correctly for the takeoff.

00:08:56.848 --> 00:08:59.565
We now know for a
fact that this didn't happen.

00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:01.830
The flaps were correctly set.

00:09:02.347 --> 00:09:04.764
And, in fact, that mistake

00:09:04.764 --> 00:09:07.747
would have been
a really difficult one to make

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:10.213
in today's aircraft since several

00:09:10.213 --> 00:09:13.230
of our pre-departure
checklists include these flaps

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.664
and those checklists
are electronic on the 787.

00:09:16.664 --> 00:09:18.998
And on top of that,
the aircraft also knows

00:09:18.998 --> 00:09:21.214
where the flaps should
be and therefore,

00:09:21.214 --> 00:09:23.564
will warn the pilots
if they're not set correctly.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.913
Now the point I want to make here

00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:29.415
is that with the low resolution
videos that we first saw,

00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:31.947
seeing if the flaps were actually set

00:09:31.947 --> 00:09:33.847
was really, really difficult.

00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:37.413
Even with good
resolution pictures or videos,

00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:40.147
the slats might be
a little bit more visible,

00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:42.480
but you have to look
very closely to be able

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.764
to tell how the
trailing edge flaps are set.

00:09:45.446 --> 00:09:48.030
You see, one of the things
the 787 is famous for

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.714
is its carbon fiber
composite fuselage and wings.

00:09:51.714 --> 00:09:54.913
And the fact that carbon
fiber is much less prone

00:09:54.913 --> 00:09:56.863
to fatigue cracking also means

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:59.730
that they can be very flexible and thin,

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.431
making them more efficient.

00:10:01.964 --> 00:10:05.247
The Boeing 787-8 has two flap settings

00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:07.040
commonly used for takeoff,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.856
flaps five and flaps 15.

00:10:08.856 --> 00:10:11.673
And with flaps five, which
we now know that these pilots

00:10:11.673 --> 00:10:13.490
were using for this takeoff,

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.307
the leading edge flap surfaces,

00:10:15.307 --> 00:10:18.222
the slats, extend
and the trailing edge flaps

00:10:18.222 --> 00:10:20.040
also extend rearwards,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.640
but they droop down only slightly,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.740
which is why they are so hard to see.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.190
The next point
that got people's attention

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.190
were the engines,

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.473
and there was an
early reason for that,

00:10:31.473 --> 00:10:34.224
especially after the circulation
of a better quality version

00:10:34.224 --> 00:10:37.691
of a video where a buzzing
noise could clearly be heard,

00:10:38.315 --> 00:10:39.665
which led a lot of people to believe

00:10:39.665 --> 00:10:43.198
that the Ram Air Turbine,
or RAT, had been deployed.

00:10:44.049 --> 00:10:47.441
Again, it's almost impossible
to see the RAT in the videos,

00:10:48.057 --> 00:10:49.274
it's the size of a propeller

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.024
of a small general aviation aircraft,

00:10:51.024 --> 00:10:53.841
but it would be spinning
fast in the slipstream,

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:55.807
causing that very characteristic noise.

00:10:56.857 --> 00:11:00.073
Its mast and door would
be somewhat easier to see,

00:11:00.073 --> 00:11:03.974
but not from the rear and at
the resolution of these videos.

00:11:05.374 --> 00:11:07.941
However, like I said,
it is possible to distinguish

00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:10.858
the noise from the RAT,
and other CCTV footage

00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:13.089
that we didn't get access to initially,

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:16.208
but that was included
in the preliminary report,

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:17.823
showed that the Ram Air Turbine

00:11:17.823 --> 00:11:19.958
or RAT did indeed deploy,

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.507
while the aircraft was
still in its initial climb.

00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:25.091
The investigation also clarified

00:11:25.091 --> 00:11:27.658
that there was no
significant bird activity

00:11:27.658 --> 00:11:29.723
close to the aircraft,
which might have affected

00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:32.991
the aircraft's engines,
but obviously the RAT's deployment

00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:35.558
meant that there was a lot
of focus on the engines

00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:38.505
and what might cause
them to lose power.

00:11:39.473 --> 00:11:42.473
Now, there are many reasons
why the RAT can deploy,

00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:45.874
and many of them does
not involve a dual engine failure,

00:11:45.874 --> 00:11:48.774
as Ben and I have discussed
in our previous podcast

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:51.408
over on the Captains Speaking
podcast channel,

00:11:51.408 --> 00:11:54.067
but one point worth highlighting here

00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:58.039
is that a dual-engine failure
is not only extremely rare,

00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:59.489
it is also practically impossible

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:02.572
for both engines to fail
at the exact same time

00:12:02.572 --> 00:12:05.022
due to most technical faults.

00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:07.405
That's important to understand,

00:12:07.405 --> 00:12:08.855
because like I said earlier,

00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:10.372
we could see in one of the videos

00:12:10.372 --> 00:12:11.923
that the plane rotated,

00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:15.571
and initially started to gain
altitude for several seconds,

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:18.955
which means that it definitely
did have power to begin with.

00:12:19.855 --> 00:12:22.289
But unless it lost power
from both engines

00:12:22.289 --> 00:12:24.487
at more or less exactly the same time,

00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:27.905
we should be able to
see a distinctive yawing movement

00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:29.072
when it happened.

00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:31.938
The engines are quite
far apart out on the wings,

00:12:31.938 --> 00:12:33.222
and losing one means

00:12:33.222 --> 00:12:35.923
that it will suddenly
generate a lot of drag,

00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:37.639
while the other engine
would obviously

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:39.273
still be producing thrust,

00:12:39.273 --> 00:12:41.873
and that asymmetric
thrust should be visible.

00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:45.273
Now, even with something
like fuel contamination,

00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:47.505
which could affect both engines,

00:12:47.505 --> 00:12:51.572
dual failures at the same time
are practically impossible.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:56.623
And yet, we saw no such
yaw on any of those videos,

00:12:56.623 --> 00:12:57.838
or any obvious signs

00:12:57.838 --> 00:12:59.472
of a technical engine trouble,

00:12:59.472 --> 00:13:03.255
like smoke coming out
of one of them or surges.

00:13:04.272 --> 00:13:06.845
But there is also
a small caveat to this.

00:13:06.845 --> 00:13:09.544
The Boeing 787 is
a very modern airliner,

00:13:09.544 --> 00:13:11.530
complete with a fly-by-wire system,

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.980
and that system is actually designed

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.762
to automatically
compensate for asymmetric thrusts

00:13:15.762 --> 00:13:18.813
using the rudder and the rest
of its controls if necessary.

00:13:19.512 --> 00:13:21.613
The aircraft will even move
the rudder pedals

00:13:21.613 --> 00:13:24.907
when it does this to let
the pilots know what it is doing.

00:13:24.907 --> 00:13:26.891
So, in theory at least,

00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:31.024
that could explain why we
can't really see any momentary yaw

00:13:31.024 --> 00:13:33.491
in the videos if the aircraft lost power

00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:35.373
from its engines at different times.

00:13:36.741 --> 00:13:39.341
Another point worth mentioning
here is the landing gear.

00:13:40.324 --> 00:13:44.058
Like most widebody aircraft,
the 787 has main gear legs

00:13:44.058 --> 00:13:46.426
that are equipped with trucks or boogies,

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:49.491
which means that
each leg has four wheels,

00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:51.125
two front and two rear.

00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:53.274
The preliminary report shows

00:13:53.274 --> 00:13:54.792
that the landing gear lever was found

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.708
in the down and locked position,

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.641
and there is no
mentioning of the lever

00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:01.475
being moved during the
entire accident sequence.

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:03.459
Now, that is interesting,

00:14:03.459 --> 00:14:05.674
because when the landing
gear is down and locked,

00:14:05.674 --> 00:14:07.040
the rear pair of the wheels

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.958
on each boogie sits
lower than the front pair.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.092
But before the gear can be retracted,

00:14:13.092 --> 00:14:14.774
the mechanism rotates the boogie

00:14:14.774 --> 00:14:16.407
so that the front pair of the wheels

00:14:16.407 --> 00:14:18.293
drops lower than the rear,

00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:19.743
and that's to allow the wheels

00:14:19.743 --> 00:14:22.309
to fit better into the wheel well base

00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:23.859
at the bottom of the fuselage.

00:14:24.476 --> 00:14:27.059
Now, normally, when the
boogies do this rotation,

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:30.026
the main gear doors open
at pretty much the same time.

00:14:30.909 --> 00:14:32.542
And in at least one of the videos,

00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:34.810
the boogies seem to be rotated

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.393
and the front wheel sits lower

00:14:36.393 --> 00:14:38.809
than the rear wheels on each leg,

00:14:38.809 --> 00:14:41.694
but the main
gear doors remain closed.

00:14:42.892 --> 00:14:44.776
Now, we don't know
why this happened,

00:14:44.776 --> 00:14:47.667
if the gear retraction
sequence actually was initiated

00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:49.984
and not mentioned in the interim report,

00:14:49.984 --> 00:14:53.984
or if that gear position
is a visual illusion of some sort.

00:14:54.934 --> 00:14:57.767
The 787 does include
a lot of automation

00:14:57.767 --> 00:14:59.868
for its electrical
and hydraulic systems,

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:01.417
all of which could have affected

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:04.018
what we saw without
any action from the pilot.

00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:07.151
So we likely won't
know the answer to that

00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:09.333
until the final report comes out.

00:15:10.435 --> 00:15:12.117
But let's now see what we

00:15:12.117 --> 00:15:14.785
actually do know
from this interim report.

00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:17.251
We first learned that the investigation

00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:19.968
was focusing on the
fuel cutout switches,

00:15:19.968 --> 00:15:22.084
thanks to an article by Jon Ostrower

00:15:22.084 --> 00:15:24.117
in The Air Current
from the 8th of July.

00:15:24.617 --> 00:15:26.317
Now, by the way, The Air Current

00:15:26.317 --> 00:15:29.251
is one of the most
important aviation insider sources

00:15:29.251 --> 00:15:32.300
that my team and I use for
our Mentour Now! channel.

00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:34.602
And they are extremely sensitive

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:36.784
about misinformation and speculation,

00:15:36.784 --> 00:15:40.468
so we knew that they wouldn't
publish something like this

00:15:40.468 --> 00:15:42.151
without having good sources.

00:15:42.601 --> 00:15:44.534
Now, the fuel cutout
switches are located

00:15:44.534 --> 00:15:47.171
on the central pedestal behind
the two thrust levers,

00:15:47.171 --> 00:15:50.105
and we pilots normally
manipulate them on the ground,

00:15:50.105 --> 00:15:52.070
either to start the
engines before a flight

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.387
or to shut them down
after we stop at the gate.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.387
They are located where they are

00:15:56.387 --> 00:15:58.638
within easy reach of each of the pilots

00:15:58.638 --> 00:15:59.903
because they also form part

00:15:59.903 --> 00:16:02.554
of several important
emergency checklists

00:16:02.554 --> 00:16:05.788
like engine fire, severe damage
or separation for example,

00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:07.321
where we quickly might need

00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:10.504
to cut the fuel to the
burning or damaged engine.

00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:14.421
Now, after that initial
reporting from The Air Current,

00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:17.021
sure enough, the
preliminary report did show

00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:20.203
that at time 0808 and 42 seconds,

00:16:20.203 --> 00:16:21.321
just three seconds

00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:24.271
after Air India Flight 171
had become airborne,

00:16:24.271 --> 00:16:27.354
the fuel cutout switches
of first engine number one,

00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:29.537
then a second later,
engine number two

00:16:29.537 --> 00:16:32.403
suddenly transitioned
from run to cutoff.

00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:37.236
As Ben and I have explained
in another live podcast,

00:16:37.236 --> 00:16:39.337
there are a couple of features designed

00:16:39.337 --> 00:16:41.737
in these switches to
make sure that nobody

00:16:41.737 --> 00:16:45.338
can bump or move them accidentally.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:48.324
First, there are two big ears poking out

00:16:48.324 --> 00:16:50.625
of the pedestal on
either side of the switches

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:53.692
to shield them from
any accidental bumping.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.332
And secondly, the
switches themselves

00:16:56.332 --> 00:16:58.755
can't simply be flipped back and forth.

00:16:58.755 --> 00:17:01.788
No, to move them, you
first need to pull upwards,

00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:04.088
then pivot the switch
over into a new position

00:17:04.088 --> 00:17:06.271
and then release it into its new notch.

00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:08.958
This is a well-proven design.

00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.523
Other switches in Boeing cockpits work

00:17:10.523 --> 00:17:12.372
in very much the same way,

00:17:12.372 --> 00:17:13.922
like the landing gear lever for example,

00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:15.638
which also needs to be pulled out

00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:17.323
and then rotated and released.

00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:19.088
Now, I should mention

00:17:19.088 --> 00:17:21.871
that the preliminary report
also highlights an FAA

00:17:21.871 --> 00:17:24.117
Special Airworthiness
Information Bulletin,

00:17:24.117 --> 00:17:28.184
or SAIB, that was
released back in 2018.

00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:31.267
That bulletin involved
the locking feature

00:17:31.267 --> 00:17:33.434
of the fuel
control switches like these,

00:17:33.434 --> 00:17:36.667
but ones that were
installed on Boeing 737s.

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:38.917
And the bulletin said
that some of these switches

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.217
were apparently installed

00:17:40.217 --> 00:17:43.567
with the locking feature disengaged
or not up to standard.

00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:46.551
But that was, however, not considered

00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:48.801
an unsafe condition by the FAA,

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.451
and even though an inspection

00:17:50.451 --> 00:17:53.159
of these switches was recommended,

00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:54.826
it was never made mandatory.

00:17:55.859 --> 00:17:56.943
The interim report states

00:17:56.943 --> 00:18:00.626
that Air India had
not made this voluntary inspection

00:18:00.626 --> 00:18:02.227
of this particular aircraft,

00:18:02.227 --> 00:18:03.893
but it's important to point out here

00:18:03.893 --> 00:18:07.309
that there are no reports
in the history of this aircraft

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:11.010
showing any critical problems
with these specific switches.

00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:13.977
On top of that,
the report also points out

00:18:13.977 --> 00:18:15.693
that the fuel control module

00:18:15.693 --> 00:18:18.243
that includes these
switches was replaced

00:18:18.243 --> 00:18:22.292
on this aircraft twice
after this SAIB was issued,

00:18:22.292 --> 00:18:25.108
once in 2019 and again in 2023,

00:18:25.108 --> 00:18:26.826
for reasons that had nothing to do

00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:28.394
with the fuel control switches.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:31.393
Now, I really want
to stress that at this point,

00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:32.860
we do not know how

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.026
or why these switches were moved,

00:18:35.026 --> 00:18:39.076
but we know that one
of the pilots did ask the other,

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.592
why did he cut off?

00:18:40.592 --> 00:18:43.410
And the other pilot replied
that he did not do so.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.509
Those statements will be
the subject of a lot of scrutiny

00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:49.276
by the investigation going forward,

00:18:49.276 --> 00:18:51.460
but at the moment it can be interpreted

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.009
in two different ways.

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:57.110
One that the pilots did,
in fact, not move the switches,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.311
but the other that one of them did

00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:01.195
but just didn't own up to it.

00:19:02.244 --> 00:19:05.211
In any case, the aircraft
did as it was told.

00:19:06.027 --> 00:19:08.160
Fuel to the engines
was immediately cut off,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.778
and the engines
quickly started rolling back.

00:19:11.194 --> 00:19:13.093
And that obviously was what triggered

00:19:13.093 --> 00:19:15.460
the release of the
Ram Air turbine in the back,

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.877
which I mentioned earlier.

00:19:18.044 --> 00:19:21.327
Then, at a time 0808
and 52 seconds,

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.361
10 seconds after
the fuel control switches

00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:24.610
were moved to cut off,

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.345
someone then moved the
engine one switch back to run,

00:19:28.345 --> 00:19:31.460
and four seconds later also
the switch for engine number two.

00:19:32.627 --> 00:19:34.328
At the same time,
the aircraft automatically

00:19:34.328 --> 00:19:37.311
initiated the start
of its auxiliary power unit,

00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:40.228
the APU, to give the
aircraft some extra electrical power.

00:19:40.228 --> 00:19:42.594
But unlike the Ram Air turbine,

00:19:42.594 --> 00:19:44.135
which started supplying the aircraft

00:19:44.135 --> 00:19:47.368
with hydraulics just five seconds
after it was deployed,

00:19:47.368 --> 00:19:50.184
the APU likely never
had time to come online.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.801
However, some other systems in the 787

00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:55.734
were working to save the aircraft

00:19:55.734 --> 00:19:57.268
and its passengers and crew.

00:19:57.618 --> 00:20:00.302
When the fuel cut-off
switches are moved back to run

00:20:00.302 --> 00:20:01.734
and the plane is in flight,

00:20:01.734 --> 00:20:03.869
the engine electronics
automatically attempt

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.518
to relight the engines
as soon as possible.

00:20:07.385 --> 00:20:09.251
So that was what now happened.

00:20:09.718 --> 00:20:11.001
The flight data recorder showed

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.651
that the exhaust gas temperatures, or EGT,

00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:16.235
for both engines now started rising.

00:20:17.034 --> 00:20:20.100
Engine number one,
whose switch was restored first,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.668
stopped its deceleration
and started to recover.

00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:25.602
Engine number two was a bit slower,

00:20:25.602 --> 00:20:29.485
but in any case, by this point,
it was already too late.

00:20:30.717 --> 00:20:34.451
13 seconds after the first
engine switch was moved to run,

00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:36.502
one of the pilots made a Mayday call,

00:20:36.502 --> 00:20:39.619
whose exact wording
was not quoted in the report.

00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:42.818
And just another six seconds later,

00:20:42.818 --> 00:20:45.951
the aircraft hit the northeast
wall of a nearby building

00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:49.069
with an estimated nose-up
angle of about eight degrees.

00:20:50.335 --> 00:20:52.851
When it did so, it quickly disintegrated,

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.302
with pieces of its fuselage,

00:20:54.302 --> 00:20:55.918
wings and engines
subsequently hitting

00:20:55.918 --> 00:20:57.834
four more buildings around,

00:20:57.834 --> 00:21:00.718
and its enormous fuel load caught fire.

00:21:01.883 --> 00:21:05.069
All but one of the plane's 242 occupants,

00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:07.019
plus 19 people on the ground,

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:09.552
lost their lives in the crash,
and many more on the ground

00:21:09.552 --> 00:21:11.117
were seriously injured.

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:15.468
So where do we go from here then?

00:21:16.285 --> 00:21:19.202
Well, again, this is
a preliminary investigation report,

00:21:19.202 --> 00:21:20.235
which is intended only

00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:22.768
as a factual account of what happened.

00:21:23.534 --> 00:21:25.219
We will know the full story

00:21:25.219 --> 00:21:27.101
when the final report is released,

00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:29.685
likely in a year or two from now.

00:21:30.752 --> 00:21:32.952
Until then, I would really
recommend everyone

00:21:32.952 --> 00:21:36.702
to try to stay clear of
speculation around the Boeing 787,

00:21:36.702 --> 00:21:38.851
Air India and everything else here,

00:21:38.851 --> 00:21:40.335
until the investigation comes

00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:43.384
with actionable safety actions to take,

00:21:43.384 --> 00:21:45.401
because only then can we be sure

00:21:45.401 --> 00:21:46.867
that all of the different angles

00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:48.517
have been taken into account.

00:21:49.567 --> 00:21:50.901
Now like I said in the beginning,

00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:53.284
the early information vacuum
on this accident meant

00:21:53.284 --> 00:21:54.501
that people started looking

00:21:54.501 --> 00:21:58.019
in the most unlikely places
for any type of information.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:01.884
Cabin entertainment system
that doesn't work on the ground,

00:22:01.884 --> 00:22:03.785
or air conditioning systems

00:22:03.785 --> 00:22:05.801
that aren't running
immediately after boarding

00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:08.584
can be really frustrating for sure,

00:22:08.584 --> 00:22:10.885
but these systems are often separate

00:22:10.885 --> 00:22:13.252
from what we pilots
consider in the cockpit

00:22:13.252 --> 00:22:15.367
and what we need for a safe flight,

00:22:15.817 --> 00:22:18.068
and they seldom offer any clues

00:22:18.068 --> 00:22:20.167
about what caused
an accident like this.

00:22:20.885 --> 00:22:22.585
Now when it comes to misinformation,

00:22:22.585 --> 00:22:25.534
there are a few clues to
look for in order to see them.

00:22:26.684 --> 00:22:29.941
The very first hoax reports
came within days of the crash,

00:22:29.941 --> 00:22:31.342
adding that a final report

00:22:31.342 --> 00:22:35.095
would be ready within a
coming couple of days,

00:22:35.095 --> 00:22:37.399
and that would obviously
be utterly impossible.

00:22:37.698 --> 00:22:39.984
So if you see reports like this,

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:42.249
have a look at the dates
and see if they make sense.

00:22:43.315 --> 00:22:45.600
Again, this is the worst
aviation accident

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.866
in the last decade, and attention on it

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:51.416
could remain very high for weeks
and months, and rightly so.

00:22:52.482 --> 00:22:55.933
Understandably, Boeing took
this matter very seriously,

00:22:55.933 --> 00:22:58.583
effectively pulling out of
the Paris Air Show in June

00:22:58.583 --> 00:23:01.500
to help assist the investigation
in any way that they could.

00:23:02.415 --> 00:23:05.667
But here I should also
point out that at least

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:06.899
as we are recording this,

00:23:06.899 --> 00:23:10.199
we haven't heard Boeing
releasing any safety bulletins

00:23:10.199 --> 00:23:12.949
or the FAA publishing
any airworthiness directives

00:23:12.949 --> 00:23:16.783
on the Boeing 787, and there were also

00:23:16.783 --> 00:23:19.617
no such indications
in the interim report.

00:23:20.633 --> 00:23:22.966
This suggests that
even though the investigation

00:23:22.966 --> 00:23:25.832
is slowly focusing
on specific systems,

00:23:25.832 --> 00:23:28.266
this accident is likely not related

00:23:28.266 --> 00:23:30.382
to a design problem with the aircraft.

00:23:31.616 --> 00:23:33.684
But that's where
we need to draw the line

00:23:33.684 --> 00:23:35.883
between speculation and information.

00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:40.300
India's Aircraft Accident
Investigation Bureau have support

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.166
from the NTSB, the FAA

00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:45.182
and from Britain's
Air Accident Investigation Branch,

00:23:45.182 --> 00:23:47.217
and by the way, this preliminary report

00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:50.315
was far more detailed
than many had expected,

00:23:50.315 --> 00:23:53.408
which I am super, super happy to see.

00:23:53.924 --> 00:23:56.208
It is refreshing to
see that kind of openness

00:23:56.208 --> 00:23:58.808
and transparency, which is
exactly what we need

00:23:58.808 --> 00:24:01.259
in order to learn
from tragedies like this.

00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:04.291
Now I hope that
you found this video interesting.

00:24:04.291 --> 00:24:05.492

and Ben and I will try
to answer them in a future

00:24:09.607 --> 00:24:11.359
