00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
that these are going to be processed sequentially.
 

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
that these are going to be processed sequentially.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.230 align:start position:0%

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.910 align:start position:0%
together and if I took the example of 200, sorry 300 300.
So <00:16:50.999><c>if </c><00:16:51.758><c>I</c>

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
So if I
 

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.030 align:start position:0%
So if I
take <00:16:52.354><c>300 </c><00:16:52.788><c>quantum </c><00:16:53.222><c>bits </c><00:16:53.656><c>and </c><00:16:54.090><c>entangle </c><00:16:54.524><c>them.  </c><00:16:54.958><c>The</c>

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
take 300 quantum bits and entangle them.  The
 

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.430 align:start position:0%
take 300 quantum bits and entangle them.  The
first <00:16:55.653><c>property </c><00:16:56.266><c>is </c><00:16:56.879><c>quantum</c>

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
first property is quantum
 

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.749 align:start position:0%
first property is quantum
superposition.  <00:16:57.710><c>Secondly, </c><00:16:57.980><c>I </c><00:16:58.250><c>also </c><00:16:58.520><c>entangled </c><00:16:58.790><c>them </c><00:16:59.060><c>with </c><00:16:59.330><c>each </c><00:16:59.600><c>other.</c>

00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
superposition.  Secondly, I also entangled them with each other.
 

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.990 align:start position:0%
superposition.  Secondly, I also entangled them with each other.
So <00:17:00.052><c>how </c><00:17:00.345><c>much </c><00:17:00.638><c>possibility </c><00:17:00.931><c>will </c><00:17:01.224><c>there </c><00:17:01.517><c>be</c>

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
So how much possibility will there be
 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.110 align:start position:0%
So how much possibility will there be
?  <00:17:02.330><c>Almost </c><00:17:02.660><c>10 </c><00:17:02.990><c>to </c><00:17:03.320><c>the </c><00:17:03.650><c>power </c><00:17:03.980><c>90 </c><00:17:04.310><c>is </c><00:17:04.640><c>being</c>

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
?  Almost 10 to the power 90 is being
 

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.590 align:start position:0%
?  Almost 10 to the power 90 is being

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
explored simultaneously.  But I
 

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
explored simultaneously.  But I
want <00:17:08.080><c>the </c><00:17:08.560><c>result </c><00:17:09.040><c>I </c><00:17:09.520><c>want.  </c><00:17:10.000><c>He</c>

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
want the result I want.  He
 

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.029 align:start position:0%
want the result I want.  He
will <00:17:10.920><c>give </c><00:17:11.200><c>this.  </c><00:17:11.480><c>So </c><00:17:11.760><c>these </c><00:17:12.040><c>are </c><00:17:12.320><c>the </c><00:17:12.600><c>three </c><00:17:12.880><c>properties</c>

00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
will give this.  So these are the three properties
 

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:16.309 align:start position:0%
will give this.  So these are the three properties
which <00:17:13.399><c>we </c><00:17:13.759><c>had </c><00:17:14.119><c>to </c><00:17:14.479><c>understand </c><00:17:14.839><c>and </c><00:17:15.199><c>we </c><00:17:15.559><c>understood </c><00:17:15.919><c>them.</c>

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
which we had to understand and we understood them.
 

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
which we had to understand and we understood them.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
another quantum particle is sent further, then
 

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.750 align:start position:0%
another quantum particle is sent further, then
