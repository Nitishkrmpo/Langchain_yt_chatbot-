make an electron from a photon, then it

make an electron from a photon, then it

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
means that an opposite positron will be formed with it.
 

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.149 align:start position:0%
means that an opposite positron will be formed with it.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
charge of positron is plus. When we
 

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.029 align:start position:0%
charge of positron is plus. When we

00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
add both, both signs will
 

00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:50.230 align:start position:0%

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
cancel each other out, so the
 

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.190 align:start position:0%
cancel each other out, so the

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
charge of both will become zero. In this way, we
 

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.269 align:start position:0%
charge of both will become zero. In this way, we

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.070 align:start position:0%
