Hey everyone, I hope you all are safe

and doing good. So let me ask you

something honestly. Have you ever

thought AI is for techies? I don't know

coding so I cannot go into this field or

what if like I'm not so smart. It's too

late to start or I'm not smart enough.

I'm scared I'll be left behind. So these

kind of thoughts are not real you. It

these are just fear and fear goes away

when you take action with right

guidance. We know that AI is the biggest

revolution of our generation and in this

revolution you have two choices. You can

either be an observer or a builder.

AI will definitely replace we know that

AI has already replaced so many jobs and

it will definitely replace those people

who don't adapt AI or who don't upgrade

themselves right now in future

definitely those people will be replaced

by AI. We know this thing. So now you

have only one choice. You have to be a

builder. Learn AI build something. You

cannot be just and sit and be an

observer. Yes. And let me tell you

something honestly. You don't have to be

a genius. You don't have to be expert in

Python to start learning to go into this

field AI field. Yes, it's true. You just

need right mindset, your dedication, a

right mentor and step-by-step guidance.

That's it. And you can easily start and

not just start, you can build something

also. That's why I have designed a

course generative AI for especially for

beginners from basics to chatbot

creation. So even if you don't know

anything, if you are a simple, you don't

know anything about AI, you don't you

don't even know what is AI, it's okay.

You can still go for this course. I'll

be covering everything here like I'll

tell you basics. What is AI first? What

is machine learning? What is deep

learning? What are neural networks?

History of AI and then what is

generative AI, chart GPT, prompt

engineering and the key concept how GPT

generate these responsive uh responses.

What are LLMs? How the things are

working behind the scene? Tokenization,

embedding, rag, fine-tuning.

I'll tell you basics of everything.

Obviously like in machine learning, I'll

not go into that much deep. I'll tell

you like everything about machine

learning. That is a different subject.

But yeah, basics of each thing I'll tell

you because generative AI is subset of

deep learning. Deep learning is subset

of machine learning. Machine learning is

subset of AI. So we cannot directly

start generative AI. You have to

understand to somewhat basics of what

are these things a IM LDL neural network

and all and then you can enter into

generative field. So I have discussed

everything here. Okay. And then at the

last we are going to build our own

chatboard also. Okay. A mini project a

chatboard. So it's like at the end you

have some practical knowledge also.

We'll you will be applying your own

knowledge. So we'll be coding here in

Python language. So you have a basic

understanding of Python. How to write

code in Python. That's enough. You don't

have to be very good in Python language.

You will understand everything. Don't

worry. Right? But at least you have like

basic knowledge of Python. That's it.

Right? And you will get here like my

detailed notes as well. What you can

download my detailed notes that PDF of

the program also. I'll give you the chat

GPT program. Okay? And quizzes also. And

I'll give you a glimpse of future AI

also like AGI, ASI. That's really scary.

So basically this is a complete journey

from beginner to builder. And then

you'll have your own chatbot also. See

every company from Google to the

startups they are integrating AI.

Recruiters wants you to understand

generative AI tools and use them

effectively. Okay. If you are going for

any like any job or interview kind of

thing there also if you have this

knowledge, you have built some projects

on generative AI then this kind of thing

will give you an edge over other

candidates as well. So if you are a

student, this is your chance to get

ahead of your batch. And this course is

generally around 2,000 but right now

because we have already we have just

launched it so you'll get it just 599

rupees. And one more coupon code you can

apply AI 10. Although this coupon code

was just for 500 student but uh this has

expired but students messaged me and

they demanded that please extend this

coupon code. So I we have just extended

for few days just for first month of the

launch of this course. So only few I

think days are left.

So still we have again activated this

coupon code AI 10. You can apply this

and you will get extra 10% discount. But

this coupon code is valid for just few

days. So the only thing standing between

you and your first AI project is the

decision you make right now. Don't let

this moment pass. Go to the description

box, click on the link and enroll now.

So hopefully I'll see you in the course.

Till then, bye-bye. A care.
