Today science has different rules to explain every event happening around us.

Despite this, even today

man has failed to fully explain every event related to nature with the

theories created by him.

When he

looks at the big galaxies like the galaxic bodies spread in this universe,

then he tries to develop theories related to them.

How does the sun

produce energy? How long is the life of the sun? In

which state will it end? How many planets revolving in its

solar system will be affected by its end? Will the result of its end lead to the

sinking of this

entire solar system? What is the future of our solar

system? What is the future of the solar system that is

present in our galaxy? What is the future of that galaxy? What is the future of

this entire universe?

What is our future?

Who is the creator of us? Thousands of such questions are still

standing in front of him and he is trying to explain them in every way.

When we

face the basic things seen in nature, that is, when

man came across the smallest particles created by nature, that is,

electrons,

protons and their atomic sub particles, then

every theory created by him

collapsed.  While he was crazy with happiness

that he has made such universal laws that

can explain every incident happening in this universe very easily,

when he came across the quantum world which is not visible to the eyes,

all his rules were left in place. The

rules that work on this world visible to the eyes do

not work on the world which is not visible to the eyes and which has created this whole universe. Now in such a situation, the

biggest problem that arose in front of him was

how to understand this quantum world. How does the quantum

world work? How does it

affect our world? How is it

still difficult to explain many incidents? While

searching for answers to all these questions,

man invented quantum physics.

This is such a scientific

field where man does not formulate his theories by

looking at big planets but

searches for rules that work on very small atomic particles, electrons and sub-atomic particles so that he can define this quantum world

well. Electrons and

protons are quantum phenomena and they are

present all around us at all times. They

contribute to every work of ours.

Quantum phenomena are strange and

man  People think that these events are

completely supernatural events but it is not so.

Quantum events are also normal events

but they are tried to be explained with the help of physics like quantum

and it can be explained only with this and

due to the complicated term of quantum world, every event happening here

appears to us like a supernatural event. This is the

reason why

people still think that quantum

physics is useless physics but as

scientific research is progressing, the

events which are not understood till date are being

explained

very easily with the help of quantum physics. The calculations of the

events done by quantum physics are

also very accurate on the basis of scientific experiments. Then man is

forced to think that such

small sub-atomic particles play an

important role in creating our world

and how they affect us at every step.

Quantum physics has become

such a big field today that it

applies to every area of ​​ours.

Today, on the basis of the concept of quantum physics,

Efforts are being made to understand Chemistry, Biology, Astro Physics, Astro Science. The

concepts which

could never be explained by the normal laws of these science streams, the same

questions are being

explained very well by scientists with the help of quantum theory.

This quantum physics has

given us many such inventions which

man could never have thought of. On the

basis of quantum world and quantum concept, man gave birth to laser and transistor

which helped our world to

move forward rapidly. It is the

wonder of quantum world and quantum concept that the computer which we once

considered to be a mere imagination, the computer which we considered to be only a

supernatural phenomenon, today

scientists have made it possible, that is,

scientists have

achieved success in making quantum computers. Quantum world

can explain to us such events of this world in this way which our sense

organs can never see, never understand,

that is, this quantum world full of mystery

and the principles of its development are

very complicated and this is the

reason that it makes it more difficult.

That is why it is

not easy to understand its physics. It is the reason for the occurrence and  It

predicts that something may not happen. It never

agrees that it can happen. It

always works with two options

that something may happen or may not happen. For example,

when a person is

locked in a room, the quantum world

predicts that as long as he is

not being

observed, the person locked in the room is in

two positions. That person is alive at the

same time and

dead at the same time. Such

concepts confuse a person, and at the same time, such

concepts

also solve the rules of the confusing world. Now the question

arises that what is the history of our quantum physics,

how did it start

and on the basis of which principles our

quantum physics and its concepts work. The

field of quantum physics

developed in the late 1800s and

early 1900s. This was a period when

many types of

discoveries were constantly being made to solve many types of problems related to the quantum world, which were called classical

physics.  It could not be explained on the basis of regular principles. At the

same time, it was also discovered

that this light that gives us energy is

made of matter and it is

made up of small packages of energy which are called photons.

Light of a certain frequency,

called photon, works to produce energy in the quantum world. At a

frequency, every photon has the same

energy and these smallest

packets of energy cannot be broken. The

word quantum is a Latin word which means

how much. In reality, the quantum

world, as per its name, always keeps asking the

theories related to this world

how capable they are in explaining the rules of this world. As soon as the

quantum world came into existence, its

concept changed all the notions that we had already made regarding the atom.

From the beginning, we

see that every thing that exists in this world is

made up of the smallest unit of matter, atoms, and these atoms are

surrounded by electrons from all sides. These

electrons

always keep revolving around the nucleus of the atom. It is

exactly like

All the planets in our solar system revolve around the sun

in their own orbit. The

initial atomic science model

defined electrons as particles, but as soon as modern

quantum physics came into existence, it

tried to explain how the electrons revolving around atoms are present inside the orbital.

Quantum physics

proved on the basis of mathematical calculations

that electrons can be

present at more than one place at any given time in every given range.

Due to this, when electrons

gain energy or lose energy, they

move from one orbital to another very easily,

but they never exist between these orbitals,

that is, either they will

remain in their own orbital or they will

exist in the orbital above or below them. The theory

of the activity of these particles played a

very important role in the development of quantum physics.

This principle

came to the fore in the early days of the development of quantum science. At

that time, this theory described the results of an experiment.

Explaining that light and matter have the

properties of both particles and waves. It

depends on how they are being measured.

Today we know

that these different forms of energy are neither

particles nor waves. They are

special quantum matters which

cannot be easily bound by any theory.

According to the wave particle duality principle, all substances have the

properties of both particles and waves.

This is a basic concept of quantum physics in modern quantum physics. At the

stage when this world is

seen or measured or

felt by humans, at that stage

any object can either be a particle

or show the property of waves. It is not

that the same object is a wave

and the same object is a particle.

This does not happen at the very micro level of atoms,

but when an attempt is made to understand their physics,

it comes to light that all the matter

and light

show the properties of particles.

Sometimes they show the properties of waves,

in such a situation the situation becomes very strange

because quantum physics defines some events on the

basis of the wave properties of light, while

it defines some events

on the basis of particle properties. In

this way it is very difficult to understand

when any thing will be waves and when it will be

particles, but one thing is clear from this that

every thing is both, that is, it is

exactly like two sides of a coin

where there is head on one side and tail on the other.

When the toss is done, the possibility is

of both, but what we see

or what is in front of us is the result.

Now if the

result in front of us is head on tossing, it does

not mean that the coin does not have tail and when the

toss is tail, it does

not mean at all that there is no head,

both the properties exist with it, but

it depends on how we are

measuring the events. These two things are

opposite to each other, but

without one of the two, the other

cannot exist, that is, both are necessary.

Otherwise, matter or matter will not exist.

Now if we talk about the ancient Greek philosopher Rastas, while

telling us about the nature of light, he said that

light acts like a wave in the air, while on the

other hand, another Greek

thinker Democrat gave a statement contrary to this and

said that whatever we can see in this universe,

all those things are

made up of particles, even the

light coming to us is also made up of particles in a way, in

this way, some philosophers

call light as a wave property, while

some philosophers call light as a particle property,

this kind of dilemma

continued till the 19th century. Slit experiment can be done to find out the wave and particle property of any matter.

According to this, when two or more waves

collide with each other, they create a diffraction

pattern, the same is seen with the range of light,

yet Sir Isaac

Newton believed that light is made up of particles

and he

also tried to put his thinking in front of the world, while

he also tried to explain it.  He also tried to explain the nature of light

but the scientists of that time did

not want to accept this fact but

as time passed scientists

started accepting that light is just

particles and along with this they

also said that light also has wave properties.

In the 19th century itself,

a Scottish scientist James Maxwell discovered

four equations to explain the nature of light.

On the basis of these equations, the

wave property of light was used to explain the properties of light.

Along with this, he also defined that

light is actually an electromagnetic

wave. On the contrary, when research was being done on atoms,

on the basis of the results, scientists started feeling that

atoms and small sub-atomic particles like

electrons are just particles. Seeing this,

scientists

started doing more research on atoms rapidly. After this,

another new theory came to the fore which is called atomic weight. By

developing such a hypothesis, scientists had almost accepted the fact

that everything is

made up of parts because everything is made up of

atoms and atoms are particles.  In reality, it is

just a particle and inside these atoms,

many small

particles are found. Due to this,

atoms also have their own weight.

In the 19th century itself, scientists were doing their research on black bodies.

Scientists were studying the electromagnetic radiation produced by black bodies and

initially wanted to make a mathematical model of it.

Despite making continuous efforts for this, they were facing failure.

When we look at sound and other events,

then we come to know that whenever

sound waves are produced from an object,

its wavelength depends on the space present in that object

because these

waves get a chance to be formed in that space. We

can understand it in this way that when we

play the flute, the melodious sound coming from that flute, that

is, its wavelength is

produced in the empty space in the middle of the flute, that

is, sound depends on space.

In thermodynamics, we all have

read a principle very well that the

amount of energy we use,

we also release the same amount.  This is

called the law of thermal equilibrium. In this way, on the

basis of both the concepts, scientists considered the black

body on the basis of thermal equilibrium to explain it.

They thought that the

radiation should also be visible in infinity wavelength

and should be infinity, but when the

black body radiation was measured, it was

not so because

nothing like this happens in electromagnetic waves. In the year 1900,

a German scientist Max

Planck solved this problem of the world.

He said that when an

electromagnetic radiation or

electromagnetic energy

falls on the surface of a black body, then the molecule of that black body

absorbs electromagnetic energy, due to which it comes to its

excited position and when that

particle collects enough energy,

then it releases that energy in the

form of electromagnetic waves and comes to a

position of stability.

German scientist Max Planck

gave a formula for this which is written as e = av.

In this formula, e is energy,

b is the wave frequency and h is a

constant value.  When

this concept of Max Planck was

applied to black body particles, it became

completely clear that

electromagnetic energy was being released by excited molecules.

This created a stir in the whole world

because this was the first time

it was proved that light acts like a particle

because before this light was

considered to be waves only. This

created a problem that it became

difficult to understand when light

shows the property of waves and when it

shows the property of particles. Planck himself was

not ready to accept

that light shows the duality property of waves and particles.

He

said on this principle of his that the

calculations done by his principle

can be calculated correctly but it is possible

that there is something wrong in his maths. But

as time passed, the

research done in the coming decades

proved that there was no mistake in Max Planck's

maths, rather light itself was

showing the duality property.

Many scientists  Planck agreed that

light can never be a particle and

for this he started looking for some other new ways

but the greatest scientist of the century

Albert Einstein had

accepted that light shows particle property and in the

year

1887 electricity flow is produced.

Similarly, in 1901 Nikola Tesla also

saw this in one of his experiments. He

saw that electricity was being produced when

electrons started coming out of the metal due to light. The

very next

year after Nikola Tesla, i.e. in 1902, Philip Lenard

saw in his research that if light

of a higher wavelength is

thrown on a metal, then

electricity is not supplied from it, no matter

how much light is thrown,

whereas this happens very easily even with a light light of low wavelength.

This

effect was called the electric light effect. For

years scientists could not

find out

why electrons were coming out from a metal due to low wavelength, whereas

electrons were not being released even after throwing more light of higher wavelength on the same metal.

Einstein solved this problem

by Max Planck's theory.

He said that light is actually a

particle and every

particle of light has the energy calculated by Planck,

but here

wavelength and frequency have a completely opposite

relationship, that is, when the wavelength is very

high, the frequency of the light particles will be

low and due to this their

energy will also be low. On the other hand, if the

wavelength is low, the frequency of the light particles will be

high and due to this

their energy will also be high. In this way,

this puzzle was solved very easily that

why no matter was showing electrolyte effect at high wavelength.

As soon as a little light of low wavelength

fell on any metal, it would have very

high energy and due to this,

electron particles would start releasing from the matter due to low wavelength light. At the same time,

high wavelength means very

low energy and due to this,

even if more light is thrown due to low energy, then the electron particles start getting released from the matter.  For the theory that

electron particles are not released from matter,

Albert Einstein was

awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921

and on the same concept, the

Nobel Prize for Physics had already been awarded to Max Planck in 1918.

Another

theory, super position, has made a very

important contribution in creating the basic concept of quantum physics. This concept

makes quantum physics quite typical.

We can understand it in this way that when we

try to touch the surface of a pond from two different points at the same time, then waves emerge from each point and

start spreading towards the outer surface. In

this way, these waves, on interacting with each other,

form a very complicated pattern where both these waves

meet. In this way, the

meeting of waves is called super position for waves. In

this way, in quantum science,

similar properties are also found in sub-atomic particles like electrons and photons,

which can be added to each other and in

this way they form a superposed position

in quantum physics.  Quantums are

mathematical. They are defined as any equation

that

describes the possibilities of any matter present in any state. Quantum

mathematical equations provide information about the possibility of an electron

moving at a particular speed or

being at any particular place.

When an

electron is in any one position,

different states can be

considered as different results, each of which has a

special possibility of being observed. One can be said to be

in a super position of two different speeds

or at two different places simultaneously, that

is, it can be said that the

electron can be present at two places simultaneously.

This concept of super position can

take the concept of quantum computer much further. It is

very difficult to imagine this,

like Schrödinger's cat which is

locked in a box.

A radioactive element is also present in that box.

When it is locked, there is a

possibility that either the cat is dead

or still alive. The

theory of quantum physics says that the

cat is alive at the same time.  It is alive and dead

and will remain so until we open that box and

look at it. The same happens in the quantum world as

well. An electron

remains in all its possible positions until it is

not being observed and when we

measure it, it appears to

us in any one of its possible positions. The

super position

can be understood in this way that there is a question in mathematics,

x = 4. When we solve this equation,

we get

one answer of this equation x = e + 2 and the other answer is -2. In

this way,

two different answers come for the same question and both the answers are

correct for this equation. In this way,

both the answers obtained are

super posed for this mathematical equation. Now the

question arises that

how do scientists detect the super position of any elements?

Many experiments have been done by scientists to prove

that there is definitely a super position of an element.  The

position is the light we see  The light

which is present around us is a

combination of many types of positions.

It has pixels and valleys which

rotate it in different directions.

In other words, we can say

that light in a super position of this differently

polarized state changes when these rays of light

interact with their surroundings.

We

can understand it in this way. We take two filters

which permit light to enter vertically.

Both the filters are at a

little distance from each other and they are

placed in front of any light source.

Here the behavior of light is different at different positions. So

when both the

filters are in vertical position, then the

light passes completely through both these filters.

But as soon as one filter is

rotated a little and

it is rotated by about 45 degrees, then the

amount of light passing through it is halved

and when it is rotated to an angle of 90°, then no light passes

through it. In

this way, if we assume

that there is no super position of light, then the light passes through both these filters.  If there was no position, then

as soon as the second filter is

rotated by an angle of one degree, the light should have

stopped completely because the

light coming out of the first filter is

vertically polarized, but

now we make this experiment a little

complicated and now a diagonal filter is placed between the

vertical filter and the horizontal filter of light, in

such a case only a small amount of light is

allowed to pass and this also

happens due to the super position of the light, the new

filter allows the light coming from the horizontal filter to

pass at 50 because the new

filter is also diagonal relative to the vertical center

and the horizontal filter will

allow only the light to pass at 50. In this

way, the work of resetting the super position of the light is done by the diagonal filter, due to

which there is a

greater possibility of it being vertically horizontal. Uncertainty makes quantum physics

more complicated. The

Uncertainty Principle believes

that we measure the speed of every object moving in our daily life.  We

can do this and at the same time

we can also find out where it is located, but

this is not possible in the quantum world.

A principle called Uncertainty works with the particles found there,

which makes it very difficult to find out at

what speed a particle is moving

and where it will be found. So, the principle of Uncertainty, formulated by German

physicist and Nobel Prize winner

Heisenberg in 1927,

says that the

position and speed of any particle, such as the

position and speed of any photon or electron,

cannot be measured simultaneously with accuracy. The more we

reduce the position of a particle,

the less we will be able to know about its speed. So,

we

can explain it in other words in this way that if we

make a turtle of the size of an electron,

then in such a position we

can calculate only one of the two, either its speed or its position, with accuracy.

If we try to measure the speed and location of that turtle at the same time, then

it is not possible.  No, in this

way, it

keeps getting complicated on the basis of the principles of quantum physics.

Similarly, the quantum entanglement theory makes this quantum physics the

most complicated. To study

quantum

entanglement,

scientists try to create two entanglement particles

using a special type of crystal. In

this way,

two entangle particles made of the same material are

sent to different places where an

attempt is made to measure them together.

If we believe that the

spin of an entangle particle at one place is up, then the spin of

its entangle particle placed at another place will

automatically go down. But if we

change the spin of the up spin antangle particle and make it down, then the

spin of its entangle particle placed at another place will automatically go down. At this time, it

seems that both these particles are talking to each other

because they were transferring information at a

speed many times faster than the speed of light. Even

when the

entangle particles are kept very far away,

they remain entangled in the same way.

If we believe that both the entangled

particles are transferring information faster than the speed of light, then that principle of

Albert Einstein's Special Theory of

Relativity will be completely

over, in which he said that the maximum speed of transfer of

any information in this space

cannot be more than the speed of light. Now in such a situation, it becomes

very difficult to understand how

both the entangled particles were

sharing information with each other,

but if scientists are to be believed, the

principle of relativity does not end here.

Scientists explain this by saying that entanglement

particles exist

only in combined position, that is, if we come to

know that the spin of one entangled particle is

up, then we can tell that the spin of the other

entangled particle will be down.

We can understand this in a better way.

Suppose if we have an energetic

particle, that is, a photon, we can

separate its spins from the other entangled particle.  We can make entangle particles

because Einstein's theory is equal to

mc1 allows us to

convert energy into mass,

but in our universe some rules

work in such a way that they can never change. As

we know that photons are such

particles which have no charge,

so the rule of our universe

says that if we make any two

different entangle particles from photons, then the

sum of the charges of both of them should also be zero.

This means that if we

make an electron from a photon, then it

means that an opposite positron will be formed with it.

We know that the charge of electron is

minus and the

charge of positron is plus. When we

add both, both signs will

cancel each other out, so the

charge of both will become zero. In this way, we

can tell that if the

charge of one of the two entangled particles formed is

minus, then the charge of the other particle formed will be 100%

plus. In this way, the

principle of relativity is explained very well here also.  The

most surprising thing about quantum physics is that whenever

we talk about any matter, it

exists in all its possible positions and

it remains in all its possible positions until

it is measured

and as soon as we measure it, it

appears to us in one of those possible positions.

We can understand this very easily through a double slit experiment.

Scientists

tried to understand this thing through a double slit experiment. Scientists

bombarded electron particles on a single

slit and on the screen, they found that

after coming out of the single slit, the electron particles

showed only one line on the screen.

Now scientists

decided to do it with a double slit, but as soon as

scientists did the experiment with a double slit, the

results were very

surprising because when at that time

someone was measuring the bombardment of electron particles

or was watching them, they were showing

two lines on the screen according to the double slit,

but as soon as those

particles were not seen, they showed two lines on the screen.  When I was looking at it, the

results were very surprising

because at that time the results were showing that the

electrons were showing a lot of lines.

This means that when the bombardment of electrons was being

measured,

even after passing through the double slit,

double lines were visible on the screen. This means that at that

time the electrons showed particle properties,

but as soon as no one was measuring them, the

behavior of the electrons was like a wave particle. In this way,

it was proved very well

that any particle remains in its super position

until it is not being measured. As soon as

it is measured,

it starts appearing to us in one of its super positions. So in

this way,

quantum physics provides us with a lot of interesting

information which

helps us to understand this wonderful world of ours. The

theory that explains quantum physics makes it even more complicated.

It makes it so

complicated that it seems

that the quantum theory itself is wrong, but

later when the results come out, the

theory always proves to be correct. This means that  That

all the things which we can see with our eyes may or may not be the same when we close our eyes

because at that time they are present in their super position. So we will

meet with this very

soon and till then stay connected with such documentaries
