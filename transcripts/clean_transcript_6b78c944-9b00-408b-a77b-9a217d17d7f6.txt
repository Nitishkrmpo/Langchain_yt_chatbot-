Meet Avlani, a well-educated Indian

woman who travels to the US but

shopping at Target turns out to be costly for her.

After spending 7 hours in the store, Avlani is caught walking out of the store with goods worth ₹1 lakh in the trolley.

The clip gets more viral after the police releases the body cam footage of him being

questioned

as Avlani thought he will end the matter by paying money,

maybe this is what happens all over the world.

So I am really sorry I am ready to pay for

this.

That's again I understand you are sorry.  I

know you are ready to pay for now but you didn't want to

pay for then.  So I need to give you

identification.

767 If it is that much I don't mind

paying you.  For pass that.

I don't know why you keep

saying over and over.  I told you many times

we are near that.  Shoplifting is nothing

new for Americans.  But

in Trump's America, the hatred against Indians is

increasing a lot these days.  And such

incidents serve to fuel this hate narrative and this stereotype.

Indian

Invasion type pages have been created which are leaving no stone unturned to defame our country and

its people.

And when such

tourists go, they

also get ready-made content.  I don't mind

paying for it.  You can see the video.  I don't

mind paying for it.  And finishing it

off.  I need to take these articles from as

gifting.  I promise.  But if I'm paying

for it, what is a harm.

Ablani did suffer harm.  The name of the nation has suffered more than you

and in Ablani's case, there cannot

even be an issue of miscommunication.

He knows English very well.  She knew

what she was doing and pretending to be a poor person in

front of the police or the world was

not going to help.  He is

arrested.  By the way, a

day after this incident, more humiliation occurs.  US Embassy in

India issues a fresh bonding.   It

says that if any person who is in America on a visa

commits assault, thieving

, burglary or if

any such incident takes place in the USA, his visa will be permanently

cancelled.  And if this

was the only one then there would be no tension.

Sagar Singh was detained in Singapore a few weeks ago.

They were shoplifting goods worth ₹ 1 lakh from five different places in 3T3 of the huge mega airport Shangi airport,

brother, these are

educated well to do Indians and these are

their exploits.  In such a situation, there is no

dearth of racism in our world today.   There is no

dearth of stereotypes and these people are

reinforcing the stereotypes with their actions.  They are ruining the country's name.  They are

insulting us.

That is why we call these educated fools as patriots but

fool swag.  Because like the naked king,

they are unable to understand.  They do

not even understand that the world is

not respecting them.  She is

looking at them.  She is spitting.  She is making fun of them.

Hence today's episode of Gawar Swag Part 2 is to

shame those educated idiots

and to alert those patriots who

know that our conduct,

especially in foreign countries, becomes the identity of our country.

Especially in today's social media age

where every video, every wrongdoing can go viral like this.

So this jumping around in planes,

eating in trains, becoming a worshiper of lust,

dancing around on the streets after drinking alcohol - brother, we will have to reduce it a bit

and adopt the policy of 'as the country so the dress'.

Otherwise,

I am telling you that tomorrow it will be impossible for us to

go out and for our students to go out.

In part one of Gwar Swag we

introduced you to Malik SD Khan or popularly

known as Swash Blur Malik.

This was a blot on the name of the content creator.   Used to make

indecent comments on women.  He used to

narrate his frustrated fantasies on camera

and also enact patriotic plays.   The

Turkish police caught them well.  When

they were taken care of, the ghost of social media

descended upon them.  But after that episode, there were

thousands of comments.  You should go and see

those comments yourself and see what is

written in those comments, how people are

saying that every single person of our country is

becoming a huge threat to our country,

this kind of illiterate swag like Wonderless Giri

writes that he has visited 10 countries

but now he

keeps himself away from Indians abroad and

he is forced to do this work because

people from here who go abroad,

talk loudly on the phone, behave rudely with people,

they do not know how to respect shared spaces.  It does

not reflect our civilization.  But the

impression it creates gets imprinted on others.

This is what people remember.  So Wondrous Giri

says that I try to

leave behind the impression of India which is respect, humility, consideration for others, when I go abroad.

Can the rest of us do the same thing

?  Today's episode of Deshbhakt is

for Global Indians like Wonderless Giri

who want us to have a good image.

This work is not easy.  I also agree with this

because international travelers have

repeatedly warned us that we have

ruined our reputation and

we don’t even understand

where we are going wrong and why people are hating us

and making fun of us.

Look, the clip of Aavlani has gone

viral in the last 24 hours,

but every other day some clip or the other goes

viral and the name of our country goes

down.  Now people are

not posting clips against India but are creating social media pages

and are filling them with content.

As in this viral clip, a

female model is seen multitasking in London tube,

talking loudly on the phone

and eating loudly with her hands.

Now maybe this has become normal in our country

but such behaviour

in public space

definitely surprises people abroad.  But we

also have some fun in breaking the rules.

Not by mistake but intentionally too.

Look at this brother.  Rishabh Singh

calls himself a patriot.  They

call themselves Proud of India.  They

even show on their phones that eating and drinking is prohibited here.

But then he is eating and drinking and giving a thumbs up to

show that look how big a chad I am.

How did I break the rules?  It is

because of such uneducated people that the country is being ruined today.

Our reputation is

going down.  Look at this brother,

how he is bringing glory to the country in New Zealand.

We probably can't even imagine

how many seeds of hatred, racism and

stereotypes we are sowing

for ourselves.  And many things will seem normal to us too.

We will say what is wrong?  Like

look at this brother.  Uber Eats seems to be something

like this.  The drivers are cyborgs.  Had come to pick up food.

Now brother where will you park your car?   You

will park your car directly in front of the restaurant, right?  Now if there is parking nearby,

that is for someone else.  We

will park the car in the middle.  Be it in the middle of the road or in the

middle of the parking lot.  Now even if he is

angry, so be it.  What can we do

?  This is normal behavior for us.  Now

the child will not dance on the table.  If he wo

n't play on the table, will he sit below?

Are?  Imagine if you try to interrupt any Indian parent

in our country regarding a child,

you would be in trouble.

So this work is happening outside as well.

If

anyone even dares to step near the statue of our Lord,

his feet will be cut off.  But when it

comes to others' thoughts about God,

their faith and belief,

Sanuk makes a difference.  Like

in Thailand, fruits are being plucked by climbing on the Buddha statue.

This same cheapness will

drown us.  If we are not Vishwa Guru (world guru), we will

remain fruit stealers and the

pleasure we get in gaining from the system is

immense.  That's why we are experts at stealing food from food banks,

abusing food stamps, etc.

And

we are being recognized for all these things all over the world.

We have become experts in breaking the system which runs on trust, the system which runs on a social contract.  As soon as we

sit in the plane, our rustic

swag gets wings.  If

any flight crew today runs away or does

not come to us after seeing us, that could be racism.  It

can definitely happen.  But maybe

racism may not exist.  There could only be fear.

You know very well

how much of a hurry we get as soon as the flight lands.  How

quickly we fly away.

We are the ones who are the busiest across the world.  We have to get

off the flight as early as possible.  But this

is old news.  What is new in this?   In

fact, Turkey has imposed a new rule.

If you unbuckle your seat belt or stand up

during the flight until the plane has completely stopped, you will be fined $0.  Imagine if

Air India Indigo implements such a rule that $0,

if you stand in the middle, you will

become rich.

Money will be money.

But all these things have become old.  We've

gone beyond fine shine and standing.

Now let us play cards by making a bridge over the island.

This is the new idiot swag.  And if you are

going to a fun place like Thailand, then

how can you sit on the seat?  We will go while

standing.  Ugh, I ca

n't control my excitement.   Even after

reaching Thailand, the Indians

working there are the same Indians

teaching the travelling Indians that brother,

walk on the footpath.  Don't walk in the middle of the road here.

Brother, can you see this?  You are educated,

right?  Walk on the sidewalk.

But whether it is Thailand or India or

England.  Because of our lust we are becoming more

infamous today.  Did you see that white wife on the train

?  Took him to observe him and to

trouble him.  I don't know English

but there should be no shortage of harassment.

Train India this fall.

So I was taking the same

stuff, take this one.

Because you are from India we should hang

out?

You want to hang out with me because I am

from India.  Has this ever happened

to anyone?  Are you going to try this editor

someday?  But all these things will

seem like comedy to you when you hear about the serious cases

which are becoming more frequent and

common.

Well, there is no need to tell you about the safety of women in our country.  The

situation has become such that

other countries are giving advisory that

if you are a solo woman, then do

not travel.  If you do, then it is

not our responsibility.  And the shameful thing is

that just a few weeks ago,

an Indian tourist was jailed in Singapore

for molesting a 12-year-old child

and also sending him inappropriate messages

on Instagram.  Parminder, 25, is serving a three-

month sentence in jail.

However, the punishment could have been 5 years imprisonment, fine and caning,

or all three under

Singapore law.  Maybe we too

should learn something from this matter in Singapore.  Because

if you talk about Indians and Indian students

in UK, then approaching under-age girls with the

intention of exploiting them is becoming very common these days

and a

lot of such footage is being posted on social media handles which is

defaming our countrymen and our country's name.

what's your name?

Bright,

bright.  Where are you from?

India sir?

India.  How many children will you talk to?

I guess you ask

the picture this is he knows I

think he knows he does not know what child having about

sleeping with each other

India come to

meet the police police it is a

matter of shame what are these people doing to our country

?  How his reputation is being

ruined.  Within just a few months, he is

going abroad and doing all these activities.

Recently by the way

fake news of Lifetime Golden Visa for 23 lakhs in Dubai

spread.  It is shameful that the

news was fake but the enthusiasm among the people was that

good days have come for those who will die that

brother,

you can go out of the country for life for less than Rs 25-30 lakh.  Anyway,

record numbers of people are leaving the country.

Be it high net worth individuals

or talented students, everyone is

thinking about migration.  What is the reason that

people want to go out of India so much?

What is?  Do people become so happy

that as soon as they go out of our country they just

start dancing?

I have never seen people dancing like this inside the country.

As much footage shows, people go

out and start dancing as soon as they arrive.

Like dancing in London as if

bring back three times the tax from the whites and the British or

look at that social media influencer as if

DDLJ Part 2 is being made in Switzerland.

Yash Chopra must also be watching from above.  I

thought, Oh God, what have I done to

Switzerland?

Uncle and aunty would never have shaken their belly so much in India as they are

shaking it in front of a crowd in Thailand.  Hey

bro need to hesitate a little bit and our

Gujarati brothers are a different case altogether.

Now other tourists go abroad to

explore and absorb the culture.

Now look at these.  They travel abroad to

show and absorb their culture to others.

In Austria, the song was

stopped and the entire dance was performed by playing Garba.

See what happened in Burj Khalifa.

Hey, leave aside the sights of Dubai.

First, we will dance on top of the world.   We

will perform coordinated dance in coordinated dresses.  We will put the stamp of India.  And

I'm not talking about dancing and singing in Toronto Montreal.

They have become our own local

cities.  So this is not even a foreign country.

Sometimes if such acts happen we

can say ok next but cute but when

it becomes so cringe pro max it becomes

so frequent it becomes systematic

then we should look at the country's image and the

growing hatred towards the countrymen and we should

understand that by what we are doing

we are worsening the condition of the Indians in that country.  It is

our responsibility

friend because if we continue doing such things then

in the coming days neither you are going to get

visa to travel nor

our students are going to get

visa to study abroad.  So such

people need to be stopped.  Uncle first

ate his food sitting on the floor of the airport.

See how good our civilization is.  And now

sitting in the plane he is showing off his rustic swag.  I

washed my hands with a thumbs up at the restaurant.

Oh brother what a flex.  o

Flex.  Yo I am so cool rest abe abe if you get

rid of the thumbs up then what have you done

brother, even if the government with difficulty makes something good, if it

makes the roads and the things good then for the

sake of reels we will destroy all that as well, will

spoil the infrastructure as well,

in such cases where the violation is clearly proven, the

government should directly crush it, be it a motorcycle

or a Thar car, by broadcasting it live on social media,

everyone will come in the Thar line, in two days

some of our people who are very

educated, are very liberal.

He said no no you fool swag are

using the wrong terminology.  So

I tell them that even in a rural area, an illiterate

person would not do such a thing which today's

educated and uneducated swagger does.  Hey, the

mentality of the people in the village is much more than that.  He

is much more mature than that.  Because no

illiterate village person would do such a despicable

act.  The act of stealing a life jacket.

That too within the budget airline, this is a

new level of stupidity, brother.  Hey ok ok I

know that our smart cities get flooded these days.  It

is monsoon time.  But

what will you do now after stealing the life jacket?   If you

get anything, will you steal it?  That's why

I am saying that brother there is a need to stop them a little.

Now see what Ashita

did?  Tamang.  What did Ashita Tamang do in Nepal

?  Yes.  Is a social activist.

Migrant labourers were caught from our place itself.  He was

directly urinating and

threatened me in front of everyone and recorded the video.

I am not saying that you should

go and talk to everyone but at least

record it.  Create a fear in people's minds

that anything can go viral anywhere.  This

is not cool.  This is idiot swag.  This is

a stigma of being educated illiterate which we have to

stop.  Otherwise, do you know what will happen?

Listen to the words of this Uber driver.

People will see you in the same way.

In the coming days when you go abroad.

You guys think about the people that you are

studying to hate.

We don't think anything because we are also

coming in another country.  So they tell like bad

words everything so

we make up if you are bad

or feel bad but we don't say anything.

[MUSIC]

On Patriot we

talk a lot about politics, geopolitics, economics,

and I never say

share the episode.  But this is an episode

about the image of our country, the society of our country.  I

would like you to share this

and make people a little aware

because this is going to impact us in the coming days.  It is going to

impact our children.  Imagine if someone

wants to study in a good college abroad and even

gets admission, he will not get a visa.  By the

way a quick thanks to our episode

partners Outskill.  As I

told you there is a free AI course for the coming

weekend, the course worth Rs. 10,000 is absolutely free.

I have provided the link for you in the description below.  Use it.
