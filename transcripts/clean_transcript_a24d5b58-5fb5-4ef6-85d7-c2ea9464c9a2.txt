Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump is

angry. And this time he's angry because

Russia, China, and India are coming

together to challenge the power of

America again.

US President Donald Trump threatened to

add 10% tariffs on any country

supporting what he called the BRICS

anti-American policies. Bricks was set

up to degenerate our dollar. And that's

okay if they want to play that game, but

I can play that game, too. So, anybody

that's in bricks is getting a 10%

charge.

This challenge is the bricks challenge.

They are leaving their mark on the

international system. Bricks, Brazil,

Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

The group of emerging economies known as

bricks

trying to position itself as the voice

for emerging economies and challenge

western dominance of global affairs. For

those who don't know, BRICS is nothing

but an alliance of Brazil, Russia,

India, China, and South Africa. And on

paper, these nations are so so powerful

that in 1995, while the PPP GDP of G7

countries was $17 trillion, bricks only

stood at $10 trillion. But in 2025,

while the PPP GDP of G7 is $57 trillion,

the BRICS countries together have a

combined PPP GDP of $72 trillion. The

expansion of bricks could definitely

boost the group's global influence.

The BRICS countries together make up

almost a third of the world's GDP. The

world's economic balance shifting

towards the bricks and emerging

economies.

BRICS alliance has overtaken the G7 in

global economic weight.

In fact, today bricks nations represent

nearly 40% of the world's population.

They control more than 80% of the

world's rare earth minerals and they

hold over 20% of global oil and gas

reserves. So the question is what is

Briggs doing? Why is it so so powerful

today? Why is America threatened by the

rise of Briggs? And what does the story

teaches about power, politics and

geopolitical alliances?

Let's start by understanding what

exactly is so special and powerful about

bricks that the president of America

himself is worried. Well, there are

three reasons. Firstly, BRIRs is on a

mission to break America's greatest

superpower, which is the US dollar. Look

at this chart. Slowly and steadily, the

dollar's global dominance is fading

away. 20 years ago, 70% of foreign

reserves were in dollars. Today, it's

down to 60% and it's still falling. Now,

BRICS countries are planning to make a

unified BRICS currency, which is a

direct attack on the dollar. BRICS

countries have started a bold discourse

of ditching the dollar's dominance in

favor of national currencies.

Bricks uh uh common currency is going to

be as it stands right now a currency

that's backed by tangible assets.

So India of course stands together with

BRICS nations in exploring use of

increasingly local currencies and

potentially launching a bricks currency

as well. So now if you look at the

transactions across the world, a trader

like Rahul from India if he wants to buy

oil from a supplier in the UAE, Rahul

first needs to convert his rupees into

US dollars because global trade is

dominated by dollars. So Rahul's

transaction passes through the western

controlled swift payment system where

western countries see approve and even

control this transaction. And for any

reason, if the West imposes sanctions or

restrictions on India or the United Arab

Emirates, Rahul's business transaction

can be instantly stopped or blocked. In

short, Rahul's trade is completely

dependent on the dollar and the Western

bank's approval. But after brick

strategy, if Rahul wants to buy oil from

UAE again, here's how it will play out.

Now he would use the bricksbridge

platform where his rupees will be

automatically converted to digital

rupees and using blockchain based

technology. His digital rupees will get

converted directly to digital dams

instantly, cheaply and without passing

through the western financial systems.

So this transaction never touches the

dollar. So western sanctions or

restrictions will no longer apply to

Rahul or any trader in India trading

with United Arab Emirates because this

trade route entirely bypasses the

western controlled financial

infrastructure. So Rahul will be free to

trade without the mercy of the west and

even commodities like wheat and corn

could soon trade on the bricks grain

exchange which will be priced in bricks

currencies instead of the US dollar. And

this shift has America worried. Why?

Because if some countries dare to do

this, all countries might follow. In

fact, Donald Trump is so threatened that

he want to impose a massive tariff on

BRICS nations if they dare to launch

their own currency.

You know, the brick states there like

six of them and they were trying to

destroy our dollar. They were going to

say, you know, they wanted to create a

new currency. Any brick state that even

mentions the destruction of the dollar

will be charged a 150% tariff and we

don't want your goods. We don't want to

partake. That's how serious this threat

has become for America. Secondly, BRIRC

is quietly building a new world order to

prevent the abuse of power that US holds

with World Bank and IMF. And there's a

shocking story that I have to tell you.

You know, in the late 1990s, Bolivia was

under heavy economic pressure. They

desperately needed money for

infrastructure like schools, roads, and

basic services. But there was one catch.

To get loans and aid from international

institutions like the World Bank,

Bolivia had to agree to three critical

conditions. Now listen to this very

carefully. Three critical conditions.

Firstly, they had to cut government

subsidies, which is okay, right?

Secondly, they had to open their economy

for foreign investors, which is also

okay, right? But you know what the third

condition was? Bolivia was told that

they had to privatize water. Yes,

Bolivia had to privatize water. And this

was such a horrible condition that in

1999, Bolivia privatized its water

system in Kochamba, which is its third

largest city. And the contract of water

went to an American engineering company

called Bectal. And here's the problem.

Bectal was given complete control over

Coach Bamba's water to an extent where

even drain water collection was made

illegal. And what happened next?

Overnight, water prices tripled. Some

families had to spend 50% of their

monthly income just to access clean

water. And even rural farmers who were

collecting rain water were told that it

was illegal because Becttel had the

water monopoly. So do you realize this

wasn't just inflation? This was survival

being monetized. Now why did the World

Bank do this? Because America could

influence the World Bank. Now imagine if

this happens to India tomorrow if there

is an economic crisis and we need the

World Bank. Imagine if they say Ganga

will belong to an American firm and

Yamuna will belong to a British firm.

How will you feel? It will be horrible,

right? This is the reason why BRIGs has

the new development bank as an

alternative to the World Bank itself.

And the new development bank has already

approved over $30 billion in loans for

infrastructure projects in emerging

economies. Moreover, NDB is pioneering

loans in local currencies like rupees or

yuan instead of the US dollar. This is

the second power that is carrying the

west. And lastly, since the UAE and

Saudi Arabia have also become bricks

plus members, the bricks practically

holds the population power. The currency

power is rising and the oil powers are

joining hands with bricks.

So Saudi Arabia and the UAE to join

bricks. Now bricks, the esteemed

coalition of Brazil, Russia, India,

China and South Africa is shaking things

up. In a major strike, Saudi Arabia, the

UAE, and Iran have received invitations

to join this group.

Combine that with the economic might of

China and the nuclear might of Russia,

bricks appears to be one of the most

powerful alliance in the world. So,

bricks can practically kill the American

dominance, right? Well, unfortunately,

not at all. You know why? Because there

are four simple reasons. Firstly, the US

dollar isn't just money. It's a currency

of trust. During global crisis like

wars, pandemics or recessions, investors

always rush to the US dollar because

treasury bonds are always the safest

investment option. And to be honest, we

all know that nobody trusts China. In

fact, China alone holds more than $800

billion in US bonds. So even if BRICS

wants its own currency, it will take a

long time to challenge the dollar trust.

And by long time, I mean 50 long years.

Secondly, BRICS countries are deeply

divided. India and China do not like

each other. Brazil is struggling

politically and economically. South

Africa is heavily dependent on Western

investments and financial support for

survival. And Saudi Arabia and UAE need

America for military and security ties.

And thirdly, the United States has the

world's most powerful military. In fact,

in 2024, America's defense budget was

$997 billion and all BRICS nations

combined spent only $500 billion. That's

barely half of what the US spends alone.

So even if bricks grows economically,

currently it cannot match America's

military strength or global influence.

And lastly, in the last 10 years, while

the new development bank has approved

$30 billion in total, that's about $4 to

7 billion per year. But the World Bank,

the World Bank lends around 50 to$60

billion each. So NDB is like a village

bank in India fighting against a giant

like HDFC. So the moral of the story is

that bricks is definitely challenging

America's global power. But the problem

is that it's not fully replacing it. Not

yet and not anytime soon. This is the

story of the bricks alliance, the

challenge to the United States and where

we stand today against the United States

which is practically nowhere. That's all
