Coming Up..

Hello This is Sarthak &amp; Welcome to India's first weekly News show. The Sunday Show.

The show where we discuss News with Entertainment.

New Movie of Diljit Dosanjh was released casting Hania Amir &amp; Neeru Bajwa.

The poster of which looks first copy of The singh is king.

Not kidding, just look at it once.

But that's not the point

Controversy erupted due to a Pakistani actress Hania Amir

She shouldn't be in the movie after Pahalgam &amp; Operation Sindoor

Due to this Diljit got ab*sed online.

You made your point but what was the need to say Halkat?

Although Diljit clarified that Movie was shot long back in February

We haven't released the movie in India &amp; Money of producer is involved.

And art unites us all etc etc.

Now what makes it more complicated is..

Some Nationalist people alleged diljit to be an Anti National in past.

Seems he was sure about backlash that after the release he'll get abus*d

Personally I believe neither it should be released now nor in future too.

Alright Movie was shot earlier and it's not getting released in India but..

Let's admit it, you would not be able to release too.

This argument doesn't make sense When the wound is fresh &amp; Deep, and the nation is united

When someone lose their lives then how can you give financial argument?

But you know, money isn't everything, especially when people d!e.

Let me give you personal example. Earlier we signed so many videos &amp; a project with a coaching institute

But later some students di*d in an accident there.

So we cancelled the entire project, several videos were ready but we didn't publish.

Cancelled all the remaining videos.

Because again some people lost their lives.

I believe in such cases, even if no-one ask and you don't take a stand.

It looks insensitive and it feels immoral

Too much english.

There's a Doha of Kabir.Reading many books, the whole world d!ed, but none became truly wise.

The one who understands the two-and-a-half letters of 'love' is the one who is truly wise.

An incident from Etawah, UP was in controversy.

When villagers came to know that a religious Story teller comes from Yadav community not the Brahmin

So caught him, thr@shed him, sprinkled ur!ne for purification, shove the head.

Other side said that this guy was misbehaving with women so he was treated like this.

But when you watch the Viral video then you can understand the truth.

Later Akhilesh Yadav met with the victim &amp; said casteism was there.

Villagers protested, Police had to take action &amp; arrest people.

Basic news covered.

The issue is casteism.

I won't talk about whether it's Right or Wrong.

But it's there in the society.

Discrimination based on the caste is still there in the society.

And it takes place with convenience.

People those who talk about Hindu Unity on internet have mentioned their caste in the number plate of car.

It emerged out but it happens in  subtle manner.

If you visit a village then tell a Harijan surname.

Then behaviour will be changed

It's nicely depicted in gangs of wasseypur

There's a scene in which Sultan goes to meet Ramadhir.

Ramadhir's wife asked to serve food in clay utensils.

Then a background sound came which said he's musalman so use different utensils.

This is how discrimination happens in a subtle manner.

Next news is disturbing, you may skip

Kolkata's RG Kar case didn't even completed an year.

Entire nation was angry, people protested across the country. Culprits got punished.

But how much have things changed?

Same city, similar case.

A 24 year law student was r*p*d and the accused were the leader of TMC.

Again the details in the FIR so sensitive, neither I can tell Nor you can hear.

But we can comment on the entire country after taking example of Kolkata &amp; TMC.

Crimes are happening &amp; when the perpetrators got caught so they often found associated with Political parties.

Every time No political party takes responsibility that how such people joined their Party.

No political party takes accountability After any incident too

They could be expelled, shamed but no nothing happens. Sometimes leaders start protesting against their own gov

Next News is from Mumbai, Actress Shefali Jariwala d!ed

Initial reports hint the reason as cardiac arrest.

Now if you don't know her then she was seen in Big Boss &amp; before that In Kanta Laga

Kanta Laga was a famous song,There won't be a single wedding where this song isn't played during the procession.

Like the video, let's move to the next news.

Like Please..why aren't you doing? Later you say that I kept begging for likes

You guys increase my BP while discussing BP news.

US travel department issued Level 2 advisory to US citizens travelling to India.

Travel Advisory as the name suggests is the advisory

Which a country issues to their citizens travelling to another country.

For example If you have to visit Saudi so avoid liqu*r, for UAE avoid sharp objects

If you have to visit Sudan then be careful from Rebel Groups.

If you want to go Pakistan then...

Why do you want to go Pakistan?

Are you Anju?

Generally Travel advisor of US is considered as a standard

It's given importance because it's superpower &amp; economic centre.

Far ahead in information w@rfare.

R*p* Crimes are increasing rapidly in india

Hearing this, it hurt a little, right? Felt a bit ashamed? I did too.

But on the same day this news came, there was also news of a r\*pe of a French tourist.

Whenever a country talks bad about my country then I feel like replying strongly but..

I can speak about democracy index, hunger index and even press freedom index

But how can I tell about women safety?

You can recall the last week's hotel video

If a girl passes from the market so Boys stare her as if they haven't seen a girl

Guys are s**uall* depr*ssed

But as long as the v!olence is concerned so roll your advisory

A country which sees 50k d*a*hs annually due to G*n v!ol*nce don't deserve to comment on us.

We talked about this in detail in this week's fixing News episode.

The man who is R*p!ng

He knows everything, he has seen news.

His mother, sister or any other women would have told him

The one who's r*p!ng knows that it's wrong.

I'm not saying s*x education but there's lot more things which was taught along with that

You're saying everyone is aware But I don't think so

Psychological study on the culprit was done in Nirbhaya case.

He has seen women as they're there to get beat*n &amp; to cook food.

By the way if you want to watch this entire conversation then you can become a member of our SJP

Listen to another travel related news. You'll stop coming out from home forget about city.

Proud of Bihar Tej Pratap yadav aka teju bhaiya is going to become a commercial pilot

He has qualified the selection process &amp; his training is going to start soon

Yes Biharis Teju bhaiya is so down to earth &amp; now he'll fly in sky.

The only thing missing was that he became a pilot but couldn’t join the army.

I don't doubt on your capabilities. If you were there so Pakistani would have started singing Vande Mataram

You'd have thrown Litti on the head of Asim Munir.

Absolutely, these people were taking you lightly

But don't take it personally. These people aren't bad by heart.

If I say so they like in a single go.

Do you? You won't become illiterate after giving thumbs up on my video.

Atleast show some Respect to me in front of Teju bhaiya

Whoever didn't like should be sit in plane with Him.

Next news is from Delhi. Petrol &amp; Diesel won't be given on petrol pumps from July 01, 2025.

No it's not for all. Later you'll say I'm a mad guy.

For some certain vehicles

CAQM told that from 1st July

Diesel vehicles older than 10 years &amp; Petrol vehicles older than 15 years won't be refueled in NCR

In Modi’s rule, Manmohan’s cars won’t work.

It's not alone for Delhites, if your vehicle is older so it won't be Refueled in Delhi

You think you can get it done so no it's not like that.

ANPR ( automatic number plate recognition)will read your number plate at petrol pump using camera

Will read Gujar together on windshield

Sorry that's joke from last week.

After Reading number plate it'll be detected that when did you buy the car.

Nowadays everything is automatic

It'll impact 60 Lakh vehicles in Delhi which includes 41000 two wheelers.

Personally I'm not a big fan of this idea.

Because if petrol pump won't provide then black Marketing will start.

People will take it in bottles.

And Delhites are well aware about hiding bottles.

Next news is from Indian Railways

Nowadays several changes are happening in Railways. Last week we've seen Tatkal ticket news

Now railways are going to increase Fares

New Fares Will be applicable from July 01st

For sleeper class 01 paise per km for AC 02 paisa per km

No hike for general upto 500 km

But beyond that they'll have to pay 0.5 paisa per km

If you are travelling in a sleeper class for 500 km then you need to pay 5₹ extra.

If you are travelling by AC class then it'll be 10₹ extra for 500 km

This news has two angles first thing they didn't hike much prices for general classes

They're exempted upto 500 km

You might not feel 5-10₹ more in a long journey

But it affects Many people.

At individual level 5-10₹ doesn't look big amount but..

At macro level railway will be benefited in crores annually

Next news is very interesting

People have dream to buy a house in Metro cities.

In my own experience Indian society has 2 status symbol

Car &amp; House.

If you bought a car which means you've arrived

If you bought a house which means you're established.

People believe so

Everyone wants to buy a house but how difficult it is?

TOI analysed the data of NHB ( Nation housing Board) &amp; urban income.

And published a report on the housing affordability in various Indian capital cities.

How much does it cost to buy a house?

On an average 1200 sqft house. It's like twice of a cricket pitch.

State capital and an average size house

How much time will it take to buy a house for richest 5 percent.

If a guy is earning 1 Lakh per month &amp; saving 30k

Many people don't have this much of salary which you'll save.

Still you'll take 15 years in Chandigarh, 35 years in Delhi, 36 years in Bengaluru

64 years in Gurgaon and A century to buy a single house in Mumbai.

And again this is just the top 5%

These people can hope

But the remaining 95% can't even think to buy a house.

This is the reality

Let's talk about giving more money after taking more. But before that let's discuss context

Indian government provides funds to Promote regional languages like Tamil, Odia, Telugu etc

Which is used in Universities, colleges and for scholarship purposes

Report reveals that Govt spent 2500 crore to promote sanskrit in 10 years.

Which is 17 times more than the remaining 5 classical languages combined

Sanskrit was allotted 250 Cr annually whereas remaining languages were given 13 cr.

Focus on Sanskrit due to some obvious reasons which you already know

Coding is being done using sanskrit in foreign. Don't you know?

You've forgotten the sanskrit study in 8 th class

I got first rank and was rewarded with a plate.

Ok next two are the Education related news. First is for UPSC aspirants

Many aspirants prepare for UPSC but very few qualify the interview &amp; become an officer

Mostly can't clear and leave out with the academic knowledge

To cater those aspirants, Government is bringing a strategic initiative

Which will help those students who couldn't qualify the final stage

An app has been rebranded. Earlier there was a public disclosure scheme

Which is rebranded as Pratibha setu

Data of those aspirants will be shared with Big private &amp; Govt organisation who qualified written but failed in interview

But yes they've potential. They know that knowledge

Basically... don't feel bad ORN guys

First copy..

Sorry

Second is from Central Board of Secondary education (CBSE)

From 2026 onwards, 10 th class kids will have 2 boards exam.

One will be mandatory and the second will be optional

Let me tell you its pros and cons

During our days the performance pressure, getting good grades etc was high now it's reduced after CUET

It'll reduce more pressure. However it has a problem too

Which was told by teachers. They told that the logistical problem is..

If you conduct 2 exam in 6 months then there will be logistics issues...when kids will study for one exam

They'll have to write internal for first then external of first exam. Later they've to write internal for second &amp; external for same

Kids will be busy in taking exams and how teachers will invigilate or teach

But listening it for the first time that teachers are afraid of exams

Next news is from our parliament

On the 50th anniversary of Emergency which was imposed by Indira Gandhi..

cabinet passed a resolution to commemorate &amp; honour the sacrifice &amp;  courage of individuals against emergency

Why are you writing  heavy hindi? These english medium guys may d!e under its weight.

We often hear about the times of emergency, things were this or that. Our rights were snatched, it was a dark chapter

We just hear it because it's 50 year old incident.

Many of us weren't active in politics

Most of them weren't active in the world.

Infact the BJP who's commemorating emergency wasn't born then

But marking 50 years it's good time to talk about emergency

Emergency: what? Why? When?

Why do we call it dark chapter after British rule?

And that's something we'll see in this spotlight this week.

Aandhi 1975, kissa kursi ka 1978, Hazar khwahish 2003

Indu sarkar 2017 and recently emergency in 2025

These were some movies made on the backdrop of emergency

If you haven't watched then let me give the review.

Under Article 352 , The president can declare emergency when the country has Major security concern.

Mainly Due to a w*r or a confl!ct or a rebell*on

Emergency was imposed During indo china and indo pak w*r 1965 &amp; 1971 respectively but in 1975 nothing was there

It started 2 years back in 1973. Keshavanand Bharti vs state of Kerala case

Keshavanand ji challenged Indira Gandhi's reforms

Lands were getting snatched by Government after amending right to property

SC supported Keshavanand ji and said Parliament has authority to amend the constitution

But basic structure of the constitution can not be amended

Fundamental values like federalism, democracy Can't be amended

Can be ignored.

I'm in your team Sir.

It's known as basic structure doctrine

It comes in collegium issue too, you can watch this video

Coming back to the point

This judgement was given by 13 judge bench &amp; 6 judge supported Indira Government

One was A.N. Ray. Later he was made chief justice

She was alleged of favouritism

Now cut to June 1975

Due to Malpractices Allahabad Highcourt disqualified Indira Gandhi to contest Election

You may shock that High court stopped then PM to Fight elections

What are you talking?

Yes it happened

Allahabad Highcourt disqualified her along with Ban to contest elections for Next 6 years.

This issue reached to Supreme court &amp; there her people were sitting so they put a partial stay on this judgement.

Indira could remain PM but wasn't allowed to vote in parliament.

This was like Toothless tiger or Tigress.

On the other hand the entire country was seeing Student protest against Unemployment &amp; inflation.

JNU is jobless since then

On June 25, 1975 Indira Gandhi asked Prez F.A. Ahmed to declare emergency on the ground of internal disturbance

One thing you should understand that this was a fairly young country

It had been around 25-odd years since independence, Indira was the 4th or 5th Prime Minister.

Indira Gandhi was the powerful leader

It's been Said that India is indira and indira is India

Today's Aura of Modiji was ...

Indira Gandhi has her own character Arc when she was daughter of Nehru so she was known as Silent doll

When she came in power so imposed emergency and the mastermind behind emergency was this guy..

Son of Indira, Brother of Rajeev and uncle of Rahul... sanjay Gandhi

He was Pilot like Teju Bhaiya

When power of Indira was receding so two things were targeted with single thing

The way this power gone , similarly she cut the power of Media. But we'll get to that in a bit.

When her power was receding so she captured Judiciary &amp; Rebels like JP Narayan was jailed

Few leaders in Parliament remaining in Tihar

Legislative which controls executive has controlled Judiciary &amp; Media too

Basically Government suspended article 358 which talks about Freedom of speech, movement etc

The basic structure which we discussed in Keshavanand case, Art 359 suspends that

Here Media gone there Judiciary gone

People were arrested without warrant, you may ask to your grand parents

If 2-3 people were seen together so directly they'll land to Jail

JP Narayan, L K Advani, Atal Bihari and many other prominent leaders were jailed after imposing MISA act

Now that's known as UAPA

Stopping criticism, pressurising media, not doing press conference

Asking industrialist to Buy media houses

It used to happen that time

Where do you lose? I'm talking about media

Foreign media houses like BBC etc were asked either to compromise or leave the country

Indian media houses were not able to print the news due to Power cut at printing presses

Human connection was also cut by sanjay Gandhi along with Electricity

There were also a lot of sterilizations carried out.

This is democracy, this is dictatorship and this is emergency

Imagine if you are a power hungry politician so this is a sweet spot for you

Opposition is in jail, media &amp; judiciary is in pocket, citizens have no Rights and you don't need to fight with anyone

It Rhymed

Since everything was controlled so Indira Gandhi revoked her election disqualification

And introduced more amendments

This was the time when several students protest took place

Leaders like Arun Jaitley and Narendra Modi emerged

Advani Ji said about media that

This all went for 21 Months

In 1977 Indira lost badly in the election and Janata party won the election which is today's BJP

New Government amended the constitution

Replaced the word internal disturbance which was misused by Indira Gandhi with ar*ed rebel!on

Emergency can be imposed today too but the steps have become very complicated

Now why is it important to discuss it now?

First I want to maintain my neutrality because I want 8 Lakh from BJP

Second is to understand the value of democracy

Powered state can snatch that easily

It's important to have an independent Judiciary and Media

Citizens go on more risk with the increasing centralisation in democracy

Infact when such instances happen in Modi Era..you know about Media

When there's conflict with Judiciary and opposition leaders get jailed

When dissent gets suppressed, action takes place on tweeting then people say it's an undeclared emergency

Now let me tell you another news so that you get context

America kept India in Electoral autocracy and I want to say 2 words about Media.

As per the ritual we read newspaper and we discuss the most interesting articles with you

Will discuss two. Which shows me the power of Data

If you have Data of any issue so you can understand nuances and help with better policy making

For example we've talked about TFR

Fertility rate is declining in India. It has come down to 2

TOI published an article which talks about why population is decreasing in India.

Why new couples aren't giving birth to more child?

40% have financial constraints

They feel they don't have much money to afford education and food expenses of the child

60% believes that they don't have medical access and reproductive autonomy

But when you map the data then you get the most interesting statistics

As the education became more accessible ..

Teenage preg*ancy..like due to child marriage many women used to become mothers in teenage

As the awareness increased in the society so the teenage pregn*ncy has reduced

As you can see in this Graph

That has been reflected in the overall fertility rate

Next is related to the health of our countrymen

Digestion related diseases have increased

Liver related. When the data was mapped so it was found that men have higher disease rate than women

Women face this problem after the age of 50

Middle age men are facing this problem at high rate

When you map area wise then you'll see North eastern states are having higher numbers

The problem is in double digit because Liver related problem increases with the consumption of meat &amp; nonveg

North eastern states consume more meat &amp; liquor together

This video was Viral this week. Due to sensit!ve nature of the video we had to cover it.

Vande Bharat express was going from Delhi to Bhopal

BJP MLA Rajeev Singh was traveling along with his family

He asked co passenger Raj Kishore ji to exchange the seat. He denied

Both started arguing &amp; Ego of MLA was hurt

He called and 10-15 go0ns boarded at Jhansi station

Go0ns did the same job with Raj Kishore ji which was done to Raj Kapoor in The film Shree 420

How will you become a go0n ?Vande bharat trains have camera.

Interestingly when the video went viral so he filed a complaint against Victim for misbehave and mental harrasm*nt

My fist started paining after beat!ng him my lord.

When this issue gain traction so BJP did the same which they do everytime when their leaders cross the lines

Nothing

A show cause notice was sent &amp; asked explanation within 7 days.

Public isn't that fool in this country

Video is there, eye witnesses are available take action. What will you achieve with show cause notice?

Sorry shaktiman

Controversy erupted when a Kolhapuri slipper was among the products

We've seen this a lot. Sometimes they sell hawai slippers, sometimes that bus stand Bag in Lakhs

Rich people get.. after buying these things

An uncontrollable urge to spend money.

But a thing worth Rs 700 in 1.25 Lakhs

If my dad sees that the slippers he wears while riding his bike are being sold for more than the bike itself.

he'll b*at me with the same slippers.

First, rich people reject poor people's things with disgust, then romanticize them and buy them at high prices.

And will se selling Cow dung cakes
