It was 10 years ago today, March 24th,

2015 at 10:00 am, German Beings Flight

9525 takes off from Barcelona, Spain to

Dussurdorf, Germany. This 28-hour

routine flight has 150 passengers. The

flight is captained by Captain

Patrick Sortenheimer and co-pilot is

Andreas Lubitz. The first half hour of the flight goes

completely normal. At 10:30 am,

contact is made with ATC for routine route

confirmation.  Correct.  After that the captain

goes out of the cockpit to use the washroom.

10:31 am After the captain leaves,

copilot Andreas sets the flight's

altitude

to just 100 feet from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet

and then begins increasing the plane's speed.

German Wings Flight 9525 now

begins falling rapidly.  At 4000 feet it starts

going down at the speed of 1 minute.  ATC can

clearly see this on its radar.  He

tries to establish contact with the flight again and again.  But Andreas does

n't answer.  Let's try to increase the speed of the plane even

more.  1034 It is

clearly heard in the cockpit voice recorder

that Captain, you are trying to enter the cockpit.  Let's

put on the buzzer first.  Then let's

knock loudly.  But Andreas does

n't let anyone in.

Lock the cockpit door.  1039 An

attempt was made to break the cockpit door.  An

onboard X that is kept.

But this attempt remains unsuccessful.

In the midst of all this, Andreas stays absolutely silent.   He does

n't say anything but his breathing

remains normal.  This gets recorded in the recorder.

10:40 am The flight computators

now start giving the final warning for train pull up pull up.

Loud alarms

start ringing inside the cockpit.  But no one was going to

stop that plane.  1041 German

Wings Flight 9525

crashes into the French Alps at 700 kilometres per hour, killing 150 people in one second.

After the crash, French

investigators discovered that

Andrius was suffering from a personal crisis and a

psychiatric condition.   He was

taking medication secretly.

He was on medications before the crash.  He was

going to the doctor again and again.  But the airline did

not know about this.  Andrius

feared he was losing his eyesight.

But this was just his mental illusion.   The

German Wings crash becomes perhaps the

most shocking confirmed pilot

murder suicide case in the past decade.  But that is not the

only such case.  Exactly one

year before that, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370

disappears.  Off the radar screen and

from the world.  However, no official

confirmation has come till date.  But the leading

theory is that Captain Zahiri

deliberately crashed Flight 370 into the sea.

A study by Bloomberg News

found that

commercial pilot murder-suicide had

become the second leading cause of air accidents if you consider the time period between 2011 and 2020.

And this is when air travel is

becoming safer for us,

deaths are reducing.  Now,

after the preliminary report of AI 171 has come out, investigations are

again looking at the actions of the pilots.

Without

saying that it was the fault of the pilots, this

preliminary report has, to some extent,

put the pilots in the dock.

Due to which actually a ruckus has been created.

Aviation experts across the country and the world are

now divided into two groups.

In the last episode, we showed you

what happened in the last moments of AI71

and what are the things that are now

beyond the scope of doubt.  We

now know all this from the information in the flight data recorder.

Now all focus is on fuel cut off

switches.  Due to which the

engine of AI171 stopped getting fuel.  But

why did it happen?  A good assumes that the

switches have been intentionally turned off.   The

second one believes that we have to

first examine all the possibility and all the aspects.  Only then

can we hold the pilot or pilots guilty.  Anyway, the

pilots are not alive today to

defend themselves.  And the fact that

you quietly released this report at 1:00 in the night,

without holding any press conference or

giving any response, has complicated the matter even more.  There is

no signature on this report and there are

many mistakes in the report as well.  This report is

completely silent about some important things.

Like when was the rat deployed exactly

?  When did the engine failure exactly

happen?  What was the entire conversation between the pilots

?  Was the sound of the fuel cut-off

switch heard in the cockpit voice

recording?  There

are few answers in this preliminary report.  He has raised more questions.

And

resolving these issues as soon as possible is equally important for the image of our country,

for the families of the crash victims and for the safety of passengers from all over the world.

So was the 171 accident

a hardware problem or a human

problem?  It was done intentionally.  These

people are divided into two groups, let us

try to understand these two theories today.  There was a stir in the Indian aviation circles

when renowned aviation safety

consultant Captain Mohan Ranganathan,

after the preliminary report,

clarified that these cut-off

switches have been toggled manually.  The

engine's fuel supply is deliberately switched off

as it is

impossible to accidentally tamper with these switches.  Now

because the entire

conversation between the pilots has not been recorded in the preliminary report.

We have not been told.  So

many of the international pilots,

aviation enthusiasts, watchers are

just able to guess the on-off position of the switches by using this limited data and looking at the timing of the cut-off.

And they are coming to the conclusion

that yes, human intervention must have taken place.

And this one second time gap between these two switches for turning off

imitates human action.  So he

says this is deliberate.  The second important question that

arises is that if this was a software issue, then the

fuel switches which were turned off after 10 seconds turn

back on. What

can explain this?  10 Seconds after

control switch cut off 10 Seconds

deviation

20 questions asking him did you do that easy

answer turn back on immediately

More than 50 British citizens

also died in AI 171 crash, so the case is being closely tracked in England too

and there too, in

search of headlines, see what Daily Mail

published.  The headline says it all.

Did the Depressed Air India Pilot

Deliberately Crash the Plane Killing 260

People Because His Mother Died?

Citing sources, the newspaper printed that

Captain Sawarwal's mental condition was

not good.  He had

taken a medical break from flying duty.  After his mother's

death, he had taken bereavement leave

and was also taking care of his elderly father.  He was

also about to retire in a few days.

But can we tarnish

someone's entire career in this

manner just by citing a few sources?  Is this

proof?  Was AI71 crashed intentionally

?  Proponents of this theory will

point you to a 2016 study published in Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance.

Which shows that

65 pilot suicides were recorded between 1999 and 2015.

Sometimes without passengers, sometimes

with passengers, such as German Wings; in

total more than 700 lives have been lost

in such accidents.  So this is rare but it is

not impossible.  Especially in our country or

China where mental health is

looked upon very negatively and no one

wants to be called mad,

you can forget about its treatment in the early stages.  So

that means am I also

talking about all these things.  So I also

believe the same, should

I accept the theory of human intervention?  Close the case

brother.  It's the pilots fault.  I have done all this

work myself.  I take it for granted that a

lot of people already take it for granted.  But I am

not able to believe this because

I have the reference of the meanness of Boeing and the aircraft

investigators.

I would have accepted that

if this preliminary report had been

recorded, it would have at least told the entire conversation.

I would have believed this if I had not known

about Boeing's previous irregularities.

I am talking about

2018, 2019, two new Max 737 jets which crashed

and even after the crashes, look at the

audacity of Boeing. What does Boeing's new Chief

Executive David Calhoun tell the New York

Times, hey, where do these

Indonesia and Ethiopian pilots have

experience?  I am quoting.   Do

n't be surprised.  They don't have anywhere

near the experience that pilots in the

US have.  He agreed.  He admitted it was

Boeing's fault.  Boeing's mistake was

that Boeing thought that the

pilots would be intelligent enough to counter the

software if it performs a malicious function.

But

he turned out to be useless according to Boeing.

That failure by the way later becomes clear

that Boeing had done this.  Boeing's

disservice was the MCUs software, which the

pilots were not told about, caused the

situation and faulty sensors which made it

impossible to recover from.  But if you

go through the headlines of 2018 and 2019, do you know what you will

find?  Exactly what you see today.

Put the blame on the pilots and people will believe it.

As is happening today, even at that time the

pilot associations said that whatever you are doing is

wrong.  Because this is

not about saving anyone.  This is a matter of safety.

People's lives are being talked about.

You

cannot hide things like this by blaming the pilots.  Even at that time, the

American Airlines Union had given a warning.  She is

giving it even today.  Today the Indian Pilot

Association also issued an immediate warning

that by being hasty, you are

blaming the pilots.  This suicide you are

trying to make is

not a good thing for airline safety.  And this

is not fair.  As the investigation into the Boeing 737 Max

progressed, it became clear

how much cost cutting was being done by Boeing.  There was

so much fraud going on.  How

people were being silenced and bought.

How the faulty sensors would

activate the MC software and

put the plane into a deadly dive.  Then when the

evidence came out, Boeing refused to take responsibility and

took partial responsibility.  It took even longer for the truth to

come out, I mean the entire truth to

come out.  But

when the entire truth came out, the reputation of Boeing

and the reputation of the FAA, whose job is to

stop all these things, to check the airlines, to

maintain aviation rules, turned out that they too have been

sold to Boeing.  So after that,

fraud charges have been leveled

against Boeing for years.  We have made a whole episode on Boeing regarding

their misdeeds.  If you

get the time then please look at that.  Then you will understand

that you should not believe his words.

But net net the investigators are

presenting you with the simplest explanation

so that no one will have any problem.  Neither the

airline will face any problem, nor the plane

manufacturing company will face any problem, nor the

government will face any problem.  So

I will grab that easy explanation and

throw it in the dustbin.  Unless there is proof in front of me

and you too.  There should be cockpit voice

recording.  On Deshbhakti, we are not saying

that human error, deliberate action

cannot come out tomorrow, it can come out.

But until it is proven and

verified, do not believe this at all

and I am telling you very solid reasons for this.

Now whether you are

in favor of human failure or

against hardware failure.  Both sides

agree that this preliminary

report is a crash disaster in itself.  The person who was supposed to

solve the matter has made it so dirty and

complicated.  I will tell you at 5:00.

Number one, no attempt has been made

by the Aircraft Accident

Investigation Bureau or what is called AAIB, that

brother, the genuine questions, the

technical questions, the questions that experts are

raising, the questions that the pilot association is asking, should be

answered.  Hey go away, I will

not answer.  Ask as many

questions as you want.  Yes, it is okay, there

is a gap in information, let it be.  There's nothing you

can do to harm us.  Number two.

When the official information will not reach you.

What will happen if you don't give the progress report and don't take questions?   There

will be speculation.  The

same speculation is happening in social media and mainstream media.  It's been a

month.  The Ministry of Civil Aviation held

a briefing.  He did not take the question either.

A short briefing was held on June 14, two days after the crash.

Refused to take questions.

Now when you have this lag,

everybody is interpreting the data in his own way

and that is why people are getting divided.  Number

three brother, tell me one thing, one line which you have

released after capturing the statement is

also not an exact quote.  To paraphrase,

you have released.  Was there no

other conversation between the pilots during the entire 30-40 seconds

?  You have that

recording.  Why did

n't you give us that recording?  Why did

n't you provide a transcript?  Why has only the cut off line been

released?  So in this way, when

you paraphrase and release something and do

not give the time stamp, then it means that

you are hiding some relevant information.

You are not telling us that.  And the

biggest question in that is whether the switch was

toggled or not?  The cockpit voice

recorder is not your tape recorder.

This is a very expensive system

and is very sound sensitive.

Picks up everything.

Picks up sounds.  That is why it has been designed

this way.  These switches, these

cut off switches, are quite clunky.

These are spring loaded.  A sound comes.  Whether or

not the sound was heard in the cockpit voice recording.  That will solve so many mysteries as to whether the

switch was turned off manually

or not.  Because the report

says it is transitioned.  Transition

can mean many things.  Transition

can also mean that the software

caused the transition or that an electrical

fault caused the transition.  Transition does

not mean that the switches are

placed in the off position deliberately.  And

finally not taking any clear action point.

This is the most surprising thing.  In the previous episode

also, we had told that when Ethiopian

Airlines' Boeing 737 Max crashed, the

Ethiopian authorities had released a lot of

CVR which is corporate voice record

information.

From this it is understood that there was some

disease problem with the Boeing 737 Max

and after this all the Boeing 737

Max aircrafts were grounded all over the world.

Here we are talking

about fuel switches but it is being

said that no, there is no need to check it.  There

is no problem.  We had only one thing to say that brother,

if this thing is coming out in the report then

you should put up a notification, a check light all over the world

that hey brother, everyone should

definitely check this thing in your flights, there is

a possibility here.  But the

report did not do this.  Why brother?

That's why Boeing's name had to be saved.  But

thankfully no one trusts this report that much.

That is why after the report came out,

Etihad first ordered the inspection of the

fuel control switches of all its Boeing jets.

Then

this order came in South Korea and finally, there must have been

shame in the eyes somewhere.  So

DGCA also said that these switches of all Boeing aircrafts in our country will

also be

checked.  At

least, thankfully, we are now doing this work that if there is

any danger lurking somewhere else,

we should catch it first.  Now come

hardware failures.  So if you and your

mind are set on this fact that no,

this is a human failure.  This

is a human intervention.  I have done it intentionally.   The

flight has been crashed deliberately.

Conspiracy theories are even more fun.

So let me tell you a small fact

which will change your entire understanding.

And for the last two days we have been

playing these same scenarios on Deshbhakti.

It has not been mentioned in the preliminary report

that at what moment and after how many

seconds the engine output starts falling

rapidly because many people believe after

seeing the evidence and CCTV footage that the

rat gets deployed as soon as the plane takes off in the air.

That means the

engine fails while taking off.

Not after a few seconds but at the time of take off itself.  Now

if the engine power decreases then what does the pilots'

training tell them?  Pilots'

training tells them to turn off the

fuel switch if engine power is rapidly decreasing.  Have

him relight the engine.

And this 4 second delay also explains

how the engines were restarted one after the other.

Both engines were refuelled.  An

attempt was made to relight the engine

and to some extent it was successful.

As we explained in the previous episode.

He just didn't have the height.  Otherwise, this

too would have been a close call.  This flight would have returned.

Safe and sound.  The agency

also has not clarified whether the Enhanced

Airborne Flight Recorder, or EFR, which is a

black box, records signals that

switches have been turned off

or whether it records the position of the actual physical switches, whether the

position is off or

on.  Because if it just

registers a signal,

in a large, complicated plane like the 7-87 there may be many other ways in

which a single signal can

cut off the fuel supply.  Modern jets like the 7-87

run on the F-ADEC system.

This is a full authority digital engine control

system.  Basically there are computers

which completely manage the engine

so that the engine can give its best performance.

Theoretically if there is any problem in F ADEC

, in-computer problem

, software problem or any error then the

fuel supply may stop.  Another

possibility is the Thrust Control Malf Accommodation or

TCMA system.  Like the M

Cash system was installed in 737 Max.  This system

works in the same way that

it prevents the thrust of the engine from functioning poorly.

But just like in MCS, if

wrong input is received into the system, if

wrong signal is sent to the system, if

wrong

readings are received by this computer or this system, if the position of the aircraft or the altitude of the aircraft is not taken into account, then the

engine thrust can be reduced without the

permission of the pilot.  Without the pilot

even knowing.  Then comes the controversial Electrical

Wiring Interconnect System (EWIS).

In a huge and complicated aircraft like the 787, miles and miles of wires are installed,

cables are laid which help the aircraft

fly, communicate, navigate and as the

plane gets older,

faults can develop in these wiring systems,

especially in Boeing, because there the

whistle blowers have clearly told us

that due to haste,

wiring was not done properly in many aircrafts,

wiring was done over sharp edges and metal

pieces were lying around.  Wiring was done through them.

Due to which the possibility of short circuit

increases.  I have presented these few

possibilities to you just to make

it clear to you that there is

still a lot to investigate.

We can blame the pilots later.

First the plane must be thoroughly inspected.

Especially a company like Boeing with a poor track record

in which it even kept the American FA or Federal

Aviation Administration under its control.

And even if human error is accepted, let us

accept that.  Even if we accept human error,

how will you explain these figures

?  Times of India has

done a great job.  Through RTI application it was

found out that in the last 5 years

more than 60 engine failure reports have been received

in our country.  That is, you should understand that every

month there is an aircraft whose one

engine fails and it has happened 11 times

that the pilots have

given a distress call "Mayday, Mayday, Mayday". Do

not take "Mayday" lightly. The call is

given in the most severe situation when there is a

possibility of the plane crashing.  But

in all these cases the flight lands safely with the power of one engine.

But the question

arises that when single engine failure has become so

common, then is it so impossible to think of two engine failure

?  That's why we have to

explore all the angles.

Today the whole world is seeing the way this investigation is crawling in our country.  It

took 10 days to

announce the death toll.  It took 30 days to

hold a press conference and even that

no question was raised.  After 1 month,

you have to give in as per the rule.

So instead of doing that, after one month at 1:30 in the night

you released a preliminary report

and that too had so many black holes

in it.  And you don't want to answer even a single question.

So,

I will accept it as human intervention, human failure only

when all the pilots are heard,

all associations are involved and updates

come regularly.  The government will debunk the misinformation

and the government officers will

come down a bit and investigate on the ground

because this is an air crash

investigation.  This is not their ego, those who will

always keep flying in the sky will also have to

come down and get the work done properly.

Here we are talking about our country's reputation and also about your and my life.
