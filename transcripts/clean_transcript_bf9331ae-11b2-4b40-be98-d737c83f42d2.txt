I think by now you must have heard the news

that how DRDO and IIT Delhi

together have developed Quantum Secure Communication System,

using photons, the next generation

technology as we call it and

when I used to make these lectures, I myself used to think that I should know that

this technology has not yet

come to India, will people learn about it and

watch my videos or not but now it seems that

brother, those

videos which I used to make for lectures will become very important for you

and today I am going to explain this news also in great

depth in as

simple a language as possible but

I will not over simplify anything.

But I will try my best to

explain it in the best possible way.

First of all, this quantum secure communication

system or what have DRD and IIT Delhi

done together?  If I

want to tell you in short, what DRD and IT Delhi

did together that 100 Km from Prayagraj to Vindhyachal.

Information was transferred using light, rather than photos, over a distance of 1000 ohms without the use of fibre optics.

And how secure can this thing be?

What could be its applications?

And everyone is a

little bit scared of this word quantum.  I used to think so earlier too.

Today I will try to simplify it

and try to explain it.  The

secret behind this.  Come on, let's unlock it together.

First of all,

I have used the word secure too many times here.

So the first thing is that

in our digital world, all the things are not

locked.  Are digitally locked.  Be it the

banking system, bank details or

your secret messages.  And

this digital lock is put to

protect your information

, the word used for this is

encryption.  This word is going to be very useful for us today.

So I thought I should

note it down here.

You will remember this next time too.  The digital lock

by which your information is protected is

called encryption.   There are

many types of encryption systems.  If I

want to explain it in simple language then there is

some mathematical problem behind this.  So,

those people who used to say where is the use of maths?

Look brother, your information is secured.

Because of these math problems.  That means if

you want to break an encryption system,

you have to solve a math puzzle.

And these mathematical puzzles

are very difficult to solve.  Hey if it was easy then there would be an

encryption system for something,

right?  It is so very difficult.   It is

so difficult that even our

classical computers, even supercomputers, are

not able to break it.   For example, if I

want to tell you one thing, there is an RSA method.  The

RSA method means that we can

multiply two numbers

but factorization, which is the opposite process, is

very difficult.  If

I write a number here in front of you,

any 100 digit long number, it will take years for

our normal computer to find out its factors.  And if I

keep increasing the digits like this and

I write a number 200 digits long

and ask you to find out its factors.

It is an extremely difficult

task.  Even if I give you all the computer scientists

of the world, even then if 200 digit,

300 digit, such huge numbers are

involved, then there are just a few

things which if you remember and understand, then in the

future whenever you see such information, you will be

able to decode it yourself.  So this

is a quantum computer.  But as soon as we come to the game,

till now we believed that all the

mathematical puzzles are unbreakable.

These encryption systems can never end.

It can never be broken.

And that's where this brother quantum computer comes into the game

and

how is such estimation done?  It

is about to happen.  Understand this quantum computer like this,

it has a master key.  It

can open the lock of any door.

Can break any encryption system.

This problem which we thought was almost

impossible to solve, if we

fix a particular time

in which this problem has to be solved then

classical computers would not be able to do it.  This

brother will eat all that stuff.  It has

a master key.  You might think that

all encryption systems would be broken.

Because

maths is used here and the laws of physics come into play here.

It is based on the laws of physics.  There is

no mathematics here.  This is different in this.

Ok?  So the First World War happened

because of chemistry.  The second world war

happened because of physics.  The third world

war will happen because of mathematics.

Because when the encryption systems start getting broken,

this quantum secure communication system

which I am going to describe now, brother,

all its encryption systems can be

broken or we will have to take help from that country, which will

not be done by India, now

India is becoming the leader.  Now, those who have

not made the quantum

computer and do not have the technology, will have to

take services from now on, for example,

from USA, China, even from India, for

quantum secure

system, meaning such a system which

cannot be broken for the time being, i.e. a quantum

computer will break the old ones

but these

encryption systems that have quantum computers, it is impossible to break it. I am

using the word impossible, let me tell you

why, why is it so secure, secure,

I keep calling it secure, secure, again and again.

But what is that like?  Because it

is based on the rules of quantum mechanics.

You must have heard many properties in quantum mechanics.

Like

we have to understand three properties here.  One is that

we have superposition so that we

can go into it in more depth.  Isn't it?

I will tell you this news in so much detail

that brother, you can go and explain it to anyone

and anyone can ask you anything

about it.  You will be able to tell.  There is a

superposition, there is an entanglement.

Mainly these are the two things and we

also add quantum interference.  If we

understand all these things then it means

that brother, we have understood the complete news.

What did we use first?

Quantum Secure Communication System was developed

jointly by DRD and IIT Delhi.  What did he do?

Used the photos.  Now I haven't seen the photos

till today.  Yes.  Our

normal computer, on which I am recording right now, is

all

based on the language of one and zero.  Meaning, understand it like this, there are

small transistors or switches installed inside it.

Either

current will be flowing through it or it will not be flowing.  Either

it will be on or it will be off.  Understand it like this.

Ok?  Similarly, if there are two switches then

how many states and how many possibilities can I

explore?  To four possibilities.

A 0 1 0 1 1 If I have three switches like this then

I will be able to explore eight possibilities.  You

can try it yourself, is

n't it like this?  So something to the power of 2 is there.

Whatever number of off switches you have.

For example, we can also call it bits.

Whatever number of bits

you have, whatever its length is,

put it here.  If the length is three then 2 to the

power of 3 becomes eight possibilities.  But the

biggest problem with classical computers was

that classical computers were

based on sequential programming.  What I

mean to say is that they will explore one possibility,

then they will

explore the second one, then they will explore the third one, yes we

can fast up this process.  Yes

absolutely but think for yourself when

number 2 becomes 30 in power.  Sorry 2 to the

power of 20 represents greater than 1

million possibility.

Using just 30 switches I

can explore so many possibilities.   It

means that whenever you

tell your computer any particular thing, zero zero, it will do

this work and will write 'A'

on your screen.  If you give

one zero to your computer, it will write B

on your screen.  Up to so on can be used like this.

We will not go into those technicalities.

We are also interested in cryptography.  I want to

know this word.  So

how do we get the output from the computer

?  How is the input coming?  Understand now that

you don't even know what a computer is.

This is a black box.  That’s it.  Ok

?  There is a black box.  As soon as we

give it instructions, it will give

some output according to our instructions.  If we give the

instruction zero zero then it will

give some output.  Like that if I only have

30 sorry only 20 switches.

Brother, think about it.  More than 1 million,

possibility 1 million different outcomes I

can work out here.  Did you understand from this

?  That's why let's come back to photon and

quantum.  What happens in a quantum?

I told you about this.

what happens here?  There is sequential programming.

Yes, we can do it fast.   You

can definitely do it.  Sequential

processing will process whatever happens one by one.

Ok?  Just what happens here in quantum

?  Parallel

processing takes place here.  I mean,

what will he do?  Suppose there were 30 switches

then the number would be greater than 1 billion.

If there were 40 switches, see how fast the number is

increasing.  Because this number,

x to the power of 2, is what we call an exponential number.

Their growth is very fast.

Using just 30 switches we

can explore 1 billion possibilities.

But again we

can make our computers faster.  But still there will be

some limit as to how fast you

can make it.  It will do it one by one, yes,

in one second our computer can explore 1 billion such

possibilities,

still how much is 1 billion, nine to the power of 10,

one trillion, 12 to the power of 10,

suppose it has explored so many possibilities,

suppose this quantum computer can

explore so many properties, so many possibilities simultaneously, this is what the

mind gets lost in and this is what I would like to

explore further, that this photon, for the

first time, now the time has come to link both the things.

What will he do?  It can multiply

9 by the power of 10 in 1 second but

can do it only one by one.  If the number would have been like 10 to the power of

90, then if I had 300

bits, the number would have been 10 to the power of 90. Brother, there would

not have been that many atoms of 10 to the power of 90

in our universe.  This is such a big number.  Our

computer would explode.  Combine all the computers.

Reaching this number is an

almost impossible task given a time

frame.  come here.

Bhai sahib I am not saying all this at once for one second.

It can explore 90 possibilities to the power of 10 simultaneously.

Yes,

we have not made such efficient and good quantum computers yet, but we are not very

far away either.  Bhai sahib, this achievement is

very big.  Ok?  I hope you are

able to understand a little bit.  But

why Photon?  Because here we used,

I used the word transistors.

Read a little more about it,

we also study it in 12th class.  Ok?

About Transistors Gates.  But the photon

has no polarization.  There is a word called

polarization.

Polarization means

in which direction are its waves vibrating

?  There can be two types of polarization.  One

horizontal, one vertical.  But do you know

what the problem is?  This is where quantum

things come in.  Quantum means like

what happens here?  The transistor is either

in the on condition or in the off condition.  this is what

happens.  But here the photon will have

horizontal polarization.  I also

want to use the same properties.  I am sure that

I can replicate this.  I

can make something like this.  I want those two

possibilities, either this should happen or this should happen.

I named zero and one myself.  He

just became a place holder.  Zero and one.  0

Instead of one you could have written yes no.  You

could have written on off.  You could have written Rajan Veena.  Are you

able to understand the meaning?

Could write anything, anything.  The square was also broken.  Think about what

I said.  But you could have written anything in

its place.  Similarly, here the photos will have

two states, either they will be

vibrating horizontally, its

waves will either be vibrating vertically.

I just changed the symbol to zero state.

Correct?  And here it was named One State.

And if someday I write it like this,

na s = alpha0 + beta1, I thought I should

include some math.  I wo

n’t do much.  Just one equation, nothing else.

If we assume that we have

written this equation in front of you, it

means that it is representing the state of the

system.

State of system or this time I

am talking about photon.

What do you mean by saying this?  What does

it mean to say photon?  I mean is the

state of photon one or two?  This is where the

rules of quantum come in.  They say that unless

you measure you won’t be able to tell.

I can only tell you the probability,

so when I do alpha square

in my lectures, you will understand its technique,

why do we do the square?  In simple terms

alpha is the square probability that it will

come in zero state.  Beta squared is the

probability that it will land in one state.

I don't know before or after my measurement and this is true randomness.  True

Randomness: Even if you bring the zero state 1 lakh times,

after measuring, you will still

not be able to tell what is going to happen next, whether the

zero state will come or the one state will

come.  Well, I could have written it horizontally and

vertically also.  HB is just the name, you can

write anything.  If I have ever

written this, I think you will know

what I am trying to say.  If

I ever write something like this then what

I mean to say is that there is half probability

or 50% chance that it will come in zero state

and there is 50% chance that it will come in one state.

Not before my measurement but

I will be able to tell you.  Similarly here it could have been 75%.

Depending on how we have

captured that photon.  We have

imprisoned him in such a way that

we have increased his probability by 75%.  This

work of increasing and decreasing the probability is called quantum

interference.

My quantum computer is exploring the 90 possibilities to the power of 10, but

I need one correct answer out of them. So,

this is

a process in our quantum computer called quantum

interference, which in simple language means

increase the probability of your correct result and decrease those of the rest, the

rest can also get an answer, means the answer for 3 * 5

can also be 4, but the probability of getting 15 is

higher.  That is why our

quantum computers

may not be able to replace our normal computers.

Meaning I won't do it at all.  Normally

this is what we have.

This quantum computer is good for some specific types of tasks.

Because there is a possibility of getting wrong answer.

But there is a very high probability of getting the correct answer.

We call this

quantum interference.  Increase the probability of getting it right.

And this is the magic that

quantum algorithms do, in which I keep

making videos.  So do watch the lectures also.

One property is quantum

superposition.  What I just told you is that

before the measurement it was in the zero state as well as in the one state.  After

measuring I will know

in which state it is.  So this

means here I

can explore only one possibility at a time.  Either that

possibility will be either zero or

one.  Same but here both

possibilities can be explored.  And

let me tell you how this power of 10 90

can be explored simultaneously.  Now watch

because the second thing that's going to come up here is this

quantum entanglement.  Meaning, you

take two particles and entangle them.  For

example, hit him in simple language.

By the way, this process related to quantum entanglement is

very difficult.  But suppose

you took two photons or two electrons

and made them collide.  It is not necessary to

use the photon as a qubit.  The word I

can use here now is Qubit.   The

word I am going to use here is bit.

Bit means zero one.  Qubit means quantum

bit.  He can live in zero as well as in one.  It is

not necessary that you use photos.   You

can also use the electron, the

spin of the electron.  Either it spins up

or it spins down.  Well, this

analogy is not good.  But still.  Ok

?  Because quantum spin

cannot be visualized.  But

why did I choose Photon?  Because this brother

used photos and my personal

favorite quantum technology is photonic

quantum computing.  The error rate is

very low.  I will tell you all those things.

But if we come to quantum entanglement, then

in simple language quantum entanglement is that two

particles collide and become entangled.  If you

experiment on one, it will have an

impact on the other as well.  This means that if

you take each quantum bit, its

state can be zero one.  Horizontal

Vertical.

Zero One is just a name.  Like this, if

you take two particles, the states will become

0 0 1 1 0 1 1 so what is the difference between this and this

?  Nothing.  There is no difference

brother between classical and quantum.  The difference here is

that these are going to be processed sequentially.

And these possibilities are going to be

processed simultaneously.  Four possibilities

together and if I took the example of 200, sorry 300 300.

So if I

take 300 quantum bits and entangle them.  The

first property is quantum

superposition.  Secondly, I also entangled them with each other.

So how much possibility will there be

?  Almost 10 to the power 90 is being

explored simultaneously.  But I

want the result I want.  He

will give this.  So these are the three properties

which we had to understand and we understood them.

That is all.  This is the whole magic.  Whatever is

running inside any quantum computer,

you must have seen the Kiskit language, there is

a panel language, there is a Cirk

language of Google, sorry if I am pronouncing

Cirk wrong, if

they call it Kirk, whatever it is, but what have they

done behind this,

they have kept any syntax, that means if I am

writing some code in Kiskit language, then

what am I actually doing,

whatever syntax I have used, that syntax will be

read by the transpiler, the

transpiler of Kiskit language will read it

and convert it into machine language.

After converting it into machine language, we

will tell the machine that brother is trying to say this

and then it will perform a different task.

How will the tasks be performed?  Some

pulses are going to go away.  Try and understand this.  Are

these qubits photons

or electrons or are superconductors being

used or topological qubits

or trapped ions or what else are they

?  There are neutral atoms.   The

nucleus is used.

Some pulses are sent to all of them.

Pulses mean that some electric current is sent

to manipulate it.

According to the algorithm I have written,

it is manipulated accordingly and then

different tasks are performed.

Like I just told you.

But making a quantum computer that efficient is possible.

We are not very far away yet.

But at the moment we do

not have enough power to break all the encryption systems.

But such an encryption

system can be created as

mentioned here.  Let's move a little further.  So

I told you about entanglement.

And finally let's

move on to quantum cryptography.  In simple

terms, I thought that if I tell you then

one thing will become clear that brother,

this thing is really interesting.  And if I

want to tell you a little bit about

cryptography,

what actually happens in cryptography.

By the way I am talking about

directly quantum cryptography.  Now

people are even moving towards post quantum cryptography.  I mean first the mathematical

problem which we mean it is a funny thing.

Any quantum computer had to break a math problem, which meant that a math

problem had to be solved, which classical

computers were not able to do to break the encryption system.

Then came the

quantum computer which was based on the rules of physics.

Then now we come to post

quantum cryptography.  This is quantum

cryptography which is based on the laws of physics, the

laws of quantum physics.  And

this post quantum cryptography is

again mathematical problems which are

considered to be such mathematical

problems that most probably even our

quantum computer will not be able to break it.

Because once a quantum computer is made, it will

break all encryption systems.

Then we will

have to create some algorithms and some encryption systems

that can protect them from quantum computers.

Otherwise, the one who made the quantum computer will

destroy it. The

quantum computers will make the encryption systems of the entire world

clash with each other.

Then what can we do to save ourselves

if you don't want to use a quantum computer, then

this post quantum cryptography will require the

use of such an encryption system

that even a quantum computer cannot break. We will

explore a

very interesting thing in the upcoming lectures. So mainly we will

understand the distribution of this quantum,

what actually happens, understand it like this that

this is a factory and it makes

quantum coin, quantum coin means it

makes two entangled particles.  I have given a particle

for example, here I have a

friend Veena and here is Rajan.

Ok?  These are two people.  Obviously they

will be humans anyway.  But one coin went

to Rajan and one has to go to Veena.

But let's talk about me first.  I

measured the coin that came to me and the first coin came to me was

one.  It came on the second one.  Second, I did major,

then came forest.  Third, I measured photon.

Let us go from horizontal to vertical, if

we go from horizontal polarization, horizontal

polarization, then vertical, then horizontal,

then horizontal, and keep doing it like this, if I

call this one, this one, this 0 one one, then I

have one key, now where will the second coin go, what are

we

transferring, what are we

distributing, we are giving keys,

I will have one key, the other one will have one key,

then we will match it with the normal call

and we will have a secure system

and we do not even need to measure the entire key.

Just keep watching.  We do

n't need to tell the whole thing on the call.  If you

match a few four digits, your

work will be done and a secure system

can be built.  So what are we transferring with

light?  Password

Password sharing is in progress.  The

sharing work is currently in progress.  As soon as it is

shared, one goes to him and one goes to me,

then we can communicate.  So

what will happen now?  Suppose a coin was going from here

towards Veena and then an

Eve or a hacker came there.  What did he do?

From here he himself saw the photon and

he saw that it is horizontal.  The next one he

saw is vertical.  And what did he do?  As

soon as the measurement is done.  As soon as

he measured it, we had to send a total of 500 photos.

It got 495.  I got 500.

But this Eve saw five photons.   The

hacker noticed this and sent some more

quantum particles back here.  But for a

second, if we assume that it has done the

measurement on the quantum particle, then its state will become

fixed and neither will it get collapsed nor will it

function, meaning it is either

in horizontal polarization or in vertical,

but as soon as you measure it, it

falls into one, so it has seen that,

as soon as it sends any quantum

particle here again and Veena measures it, then it is

not necessary that it is the same as it was with

me, can you understand, the first particle has come

here.  Through this it measured

horizontal.  When it

sent another quantum particle here, it also

measured it horizontally.  Well, it was a guess.   It

was a coincidence.  Then he did another major.

Here comes the vertical.  Here also there was vertical at

number three, so there was a problem brother.  When

Veena saw this after making her sequence, it was

coming.  If only five photos were

shared from Let Us, then what would have come here: 1 1 0 1 1

?  0 0 1 0 0 What happens

to entanglement due to Just Opposite Entanglement

?  Whatever measurement you do on one particle, it will have an

effect on the other as well.

This was it, they are related to each

other.  So we saw that everything was fine.

But there is a problem with this part.

His forest is also coming here.  Forest is coming here also.

Should not have happened.  This means

someone has interfered.  So we will

start the process again.  This

is quantum secure.  Because it is

like a bubble now.  As soon as anyone

tries to touch that bubble, that

bubble will burst.  That bubble will burst soon.  So first assume that

it has measured a quantum particle.  If

another quantum particle is sent further, then

any possibility can come to it.

Now he is no longer entangled with it.  The

particles that were coming out of the factory earlier were

near this one and the ones that were going towards this one were

Enteng.  But as soon as Eve saw it,

as soon as the hacker saw it, it collapsed.

That entanglement is over.  Now

whenever he sends it here then there is no entanglement.

Now this will not happen, this is its forest.  Its

zero.  No, now that quantum particle, that

entangled one, did not go to it.  And

that is the main crux of what is happening here,

I am not applying quantum quantum but quantum to everything.  No Cloning

Theorem.  Now this no cloning theorem

tells us that you cannot make a replica of any quantum system.

Can never make an exact copy.  Like what happens right now

?  You went to a party, you went on a trip to your

friend, your friend took a

lot of pictures and you said, brother

send me those pictures, if you slap him

a couple of times, maybe he will give it to you,

but yes, you

can transfer those pictures to you, you can make a replica of

things, this cannot be done here, a copy cannot be made,

making an exact copy of anything is not possible,

this theorem restricts it, I have even proved it

in my previous lectures, but for

now, again just

keep this in mind that an exact copy of any quantum system

cannot be made.

I am not going to leave without telling the reason.  It

cannot be made

because to make a copy of anything, you will

have to measure it first.  Suppose there is a soap bubble.

You have to see how that soap bubble is made.

So first, we will have to experiment with that.

He will have to touch it also.  But

as soon as you touch it, that

bubble will burst.  I am just giving an analogy in the same way you

look at the bubble, this is a quantum bubble.

You

have to see it to make a complete replica of it.  We will have to look at each and every atom to see

how it is connected.   You will

have to look from the inside side also.  But

as soon as you touch it, that bubble will burst.  Same thing

happens here as well, as I don't

know whether the state is zero or one right now.  As

soon as I become Major, brother, the whole thing will be exposed.

Either zero will come or one will come.  The

collapsed wave function.  I am not going to use the word wave function right now.

By the way that will be a different

story.  But once I want to

replicate a quantum system,

I'll have to do measurements.   If

I do the measurements it will collapse.

Isn't it?  Hey, if you want to make a replica then you will

have to make its superposition also.  I have

this box.  There may be a head as well as a tail inside it.

And I want to

make a similar box.  There are many such head tail,

head tail coins lying around.  And I

want to create the same replica of it.  So first

I will have to go inside this compartment and see.  I will

have to do measurement on these coins too, but if I do the measurement then I will

lose this superposition property.  This

was the main problem that this is the main

secure system that I was just talking about

and as soon as we

try to match them with each other, then it will be detected

and here another team, another

term comes in if there is a mismatch

which we are trying to compare with each other.

So as soon as we have a mismatch,

here comes a term called percentage of

errors.

A term is used to describe the number of errors that occur: quantum bit error rate.

Note down the quantum bit error rate somewhere, if you

read the news again then you will

understand what it means.

And let us

assume that this quantum bit error rate is

high, then it means that somebody has created some trouble.  There

was some hacker

in between.  Someone was an e-dropper.  But if we

assume a little error is coming then it could be

that there was a problem in our communication system.

Now we have to

set some limit for this.  And as soon as

we confirm them with each other and there is a

mismatch, some error occurs

in between, so we start again.

That process of entanglement

starts again.  And the thief gets

caught.  Meaning the thief is not

caught.  We come to know that somebody has played some tricks

in between and

our secret key or the secret which we

wanted to send from one point to another by

trapping it in this light, will

still be safe; this is the main

thing we have and after this,

finally we come to this quantum

distribution, it is based on the

losses of quantum physics,

all these things are based on the losses of quantum physics, it has to be

kept in mind, what have IIT Delhi and DRDO

done together?  Free space

optical link.  Meaning, without any optical

fiber, I will add this term also.

Free Space

Optical Link simply

means that they have covered a distance of

100 Km using photons without using any fibre optics.  It has been

sent at a distance of.

Information has been sent from Prayagraj to Vidhyanchal.

And the best thing is that this

quantum bit error rate was extremely low

and this was also the biggest success.  There was very little

this error in it.  Errors are bound to happen.

We haven't made it that efficient yet.

And

one more term

comes to us about the security rate, the secure rate,

this was very high because of which

I said that it is a big success, a very

big thing, India is no longer just

for taking service.  Now he can also provide service.  What I

mean to say is that now we are

developing the technology that we have,

we are building a quantum encryption system.

Now we will not be dependent on anyone.

We have our own.  Now we will

not be afraid of China that it has made a quantum computer.

Quantum computers also

started being made.  By the way, I am going to make videos on that too in the

upcoming videos.  But now

we will not be afraid of this thing at least

that all our military or

defense

information which is confidential

or the banking system or finance

or the government's strategies or their

communication, none of it will be leaked.

If we use this method for

quantum secure communication,

these two organizations have finally demonstrated this quantum secure communication

and as I told you, after this,

people are now working on post quantum cryptography.

Post quantum cryptography

means new methods which

even quantum algorithms and quantum computers cannot break.  I

mean, for now,

physics here is guaranteeing that you are safe.

Your information is safe.  And

where did it go to us here?  Here in post

quantum cryptography,

mathematics is giving you a guarantee that

your information will remain safe.

Employ new methods.  I hope that

if you believe that we combine the two, then

all our encryption systems and the

government policies,

government strategies related to defense and

military, we have put a two-layer

system in it, one is post quantum

cryptography and one quantum cryptography,

brother, it will become such a system which will be

unbreakable, it will be impossible to break,

think about it, I hope that I will be

able to explain it a little and give an idea as to

what actually happened in the

quantum secure communication system or

what IT Delhi and DRDO actually did together, perhaps I would have been able to tell that.

See you in another video

with some other interesting topic.  Till then

, bye-b take care of yourself.
